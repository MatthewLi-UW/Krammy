**Example Output:**
Front: Encoding  
Back: Forming a memory code.  

Front: Storage  
Back: Maintaining encoded information in memory over time.  

Front: Retrieval  
Back: Recovering information from memory stores.  

Front: Attention  
Back: Focusing awareness on a narrowed range of stimuli or events.  

Front: Shallow processing  
Back: Emphasizing the physical structure of the stimulus.  

Front: Intermediate processing  
Back: Emphasizing what a word sounds like.  

Front: Deep processing  
Back: Emphasizing the meaning of verbal input.  

Front: Level of processing theory  
Back: Deeper levels of processing result in longer-lasting memory codes.  

Front: Elaboration  
Back: Linking a stimulus to other information involved at the time of encoding.  

Front: Dual-coding theory  
Back: Memory is enhanced by forming semantic and visual codes, since either can lead to recall.  

Front: Self-referent encoding  
Back: Deciding how or whether information is personally relevant.  

Front: Sensory memory  
Back: Preserves information in its original sensory form for a brief time.  

Front: Short-term memory  
Back: Limited capacity store that maintains unrehearsed information for up to 20 seconds.  

Front: Rehearsal  
Back: The process of repetitively verbalizing or thinking about the information.  

Front: Chunk  
Back: A group of familiar stimuli stored as a single unit.  

Front: Working memory  
Back: Limited capacity storage system that temporarily maintains and stores information by providing an interface between perception, memory, and action.  

Front: Working memory capacity  
Back: The ability to hold and manipulate information in conscious attention.  

Front: Long-term memory  
Back: Unlimited capacity store that can hold information over lengthy periods of time.  

Front: Flashbulb memories  
Back: Unusually vivid and detailed recollections of momentous events.  

Front: Clustering  
Back: The tendency to remember similar or related items in groups.  

Front: Conceptual hierarchy  
Back: The multilevel classification system based on common properties among items.  

Front: Schema  
Back: Organized cluster of knowledge about a particular object or event abstracted from previous experience with the object or event.  

Front: Semantic network  
Back: Consists of nodes representing concepts, joined together by pathways that link related concepts.  

Front: Tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon  
Back: Temporary inability to remember something you know, accompanied by a feeling that it's just out of reach.  

Front: Misinformation effect  
Back: Participants' recall of an event they witnessed is altered by introducing misleading post-event information.  

Front: Source monitoring  
Back: The process of making inferences about the origins of memories.  

Front: Source-monitoring error  
Back: A memory derived from one source is misattributed to another source.  

Front: Recall  
Back: Measure of retention which requires participants to reproduce information on their own without any cues.  

Front: Recognition  
Back: Measure of retention which requires participants to select previously learned information from an array of options.  

Front: Relearning  
Back: Measure of retention requiring a participant to memorize information a second time to determine how much time or how many practice trials are saved by having learned it before.  

Front: Decay theory  
Back: Forgetting occurs because memory traces fade with time.  

Front: Retroactive interference  
Back: New information impairs the retention of previously learned information.  

Front: Interference theory  
Back: People forget information because of competition from other material.  

Front: Proactive interference  
Back: Previously learned information interferes with the retention of new information.  

Front: Encoding specificity principle  
Back: The value of a retrieval cue depends on how well it corresponds to the memory code.  

Front: Repression  
Back: Keeping distressing thoughts and feelings buried in the unconscious.  

Front: Long-term potentiation  
Back: Long-lasting increase in neural excitability at synapses along a specific neural pathway.  

Front: Retrograde amnesia  
Back: Loss of memories for events that occurred prior to the onset of amnesia.  

Front: Anterograde amnesia  
Back: Loss of memories for events that occur after the onset of amnesia.  

Front: Consolidation  
Back: Hypothetical process involving the gradual conversion of new, unstable memories into stable, durable memory codes stored in long-term memory.  

Front: Implicit memory  
Back: Retention is exhibited on a task that does not require intentional remembering.  

Front: Explicit memory  
Back: Intentional recollection of previous experiences.  

Front: Non-declarative memory system  
Back: Houses memory for actions, skills, operations, and conditioned responses.  

Front: Episodic memory  
Back: Chronological, or temporally dated, recollections of personal experiences.  

Front: Semantic memory system  
Back: Contains general knowledge that is not tied to the time when the information was learned.  

Front: Prospective memory  
Back: Remembering to perform actions in the future.  

Front: Retrospective memory  
Back: Remembering events from the past or previously learned information.
