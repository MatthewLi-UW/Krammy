Have you ever thought about the possibility of travelling through time? If you are like
most people, you have likely imagined
how useful it might be in some situations. Time
travel would allow you to accomplish more—for
example, to take those extra classes that you are so
interested in, allowing you to complete your degree
sooner than is ordinarily possible. The concept of
time travel is fascinating and has been the subject
of many books and movies. Can you remember
any books you have read or movies you have seen
in the past couple of years in which time travel
plays an important role? Of course, there are many
well-known novels, including Charles Dickens’s
A Christmas Carol (1843), H. G. Wells’s The Time
Machine (1895), Robert Heinlein’s All You Zombies
(1959), Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five (1969),
Douglas Adams’s The Restaurant at the End of the
Universe (1980), Stephen King’s 11/22/63 (2011),
Neal Stephenson and Nicole Gallant’s The Rise and
Fall of D.O.D.O. (2017), and Michael Crichton’s
Timeline (1999). By the way, there was another
famous book published in 1999 that involved time
travel. If you are like most others of your age (any
age really, both of this textbook’s authors are fans),
you have probably read the book or seen the movie
of the same name that was released in 2004. Do you
remember the name of the book now? As a hint,
we can tell you that the author was J. K. Rowling.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the answer.
That was too easy! Let’s test your Harry Potter trivia
knowledge again. Do you remember the name of
the object that allowed Hermione to time travel? (If
not, you can find the answer at the end of this section). This might be more difficult—take a moment.
If you can’t answer right away, it might seem that
you almost know, that the answer is, well, on the tip
of your tongue. Memory is a fascinating topic and
process. While you are trying to remember, reflect
a little on how you might describe to someone else
how you are able to remember such things or, perhaps, why you cannot. These processes, including
remembering, forgetting, the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon, and much more, constitute the subject
matter of this chapter on human memory.
Our memory is something that helps define who
we are and our sense of self (Costabile & Austin,
2020; Prebble et al., 2013), and it is intimately tied
to our ability to function effectively and efficiently
in the immediate moment in both social (Anzellotti
& Young, 2020; Hirst & Echterhoff, 2012) and nonsocial contexts. In order to get to school on time, you
have to remember where you left your room keys so
you can lock the door before you leave. The importance of memory in our ability to orient ourselves in
the present is clear. So, what does memory have to do
with time travel?
Time travel itself, while clearly fascinating, isn’t
as rare as you might think; in fact, most of us can do
it—and if you think carefully about it, it shouldn’t
surprise you to know that such time travel is intimately linked with the nature of our cognition and
memory systems (Ainslie, 2007; Cole & Kvavilashvili,
2019; Schacter & Addis, 2007a, 2007b). It is the
nature of our cognitive and memory processes that
allows us all to travel through time (Devitt & Addis,
2016; Michaelin, 2016; Miloyan et al., 2019; Schacter
et al., 2017; Tulving, 2005). We can go backward to
remember specific events that happened to us, such
as watching The Prisoner of Azkaban and the people
with whom we watched the movie. Other memories
are not tied to us personally but may relate more to
general knowledge, such as what the word prisoner
means or what kind of animal a hippogriff is.
These two kinds of memory—memory for general
information and memory for personal events—were
labelled semantic and episodic memory, respectively,
by psychologist Endel Tulving (1972). Tulving’s wellknown patient referred to as K.C. gives a dramatic
example of the distinction between these types of
memories (Rosenbaum et al., 2005). K.C. suffered
serious brain damage in 1981 after a motorcycle accident. But you might never realize it if you restricted
yourself to asking him questions such as “Who
wrote The Time Machine?” After the accident, K.C.’s
semantic memory for facts was unimpaired. He was
not distinguishable from anyone else and frequently
outperformed “normal” undergraduates at the
University of Toronto, where Tulving conducted his
work, on various cognitive/perceptual tasks. What
is impaired, however, is his episodic memory: No
matter how hard he tried, he could not remember
anything that has ever happened to him (Tulving,
2001). He depended on a personal digital assistant
to remind him to eat. K.C. admits that without the
device “I would get hungry but wouldn’t remember
to eat. I wouldn’t know what time to go for lunch”
(Branswell & Hall, 2007, p. A6).
K.C. has been important in terms of our understanding of memory (Rosenbaum et al., 2005).
Research with K.C. has contributed to, among other
things, our knowledge about the distinction between
semantic and episodic memory, the distinction
between implicit and explicit memory, and new
learning in amnesia (Kwan et al., 2012; Rosenbaum
et al., 2005; Rosenbaum et al., 2011).
In this chapter we focus on the nature of our
memory systems. As the preceding discussion suggests, memory involves more than taking information in and storing it in some mental compartment.

Human Memory 255
Have you ever tried to remember an event or scene
that you had experienced (Zacks, 2020), or been
introduced to someone and then realized only 30
seconds into your interaction that you had already
forgotten their name? More often than not, this
familiar kind of forgetting results from a failure to
form a memory code for the name. Active encoding
is a crucial process in memory. In this section, we discuss the role of attention in encoding, various types
of encoding, and the ways to enrich this process.
The Role of Attention
You generally need to pay attention to information
if you intend to remember it (Lachter et al., 2004;
Mulligan, 1998). For example, if you sit through a
class lecture but pay little attention to it, you’re
unlikely to remember much of what the professor
had to say. Attention involves focusing awareness
on a narrowed range of stimuli or events. Selective
attention is critical to everyday functioning. If your
In fact, psychologists probing the workings of
memory have had to grapple with three enduring
questions:
1. How does information get into memory?
2. How is information maintained in memory?
3. How is information pulled back out of memory?
These three questions correspond to the three key
processes involved in memory: encoding (getting
information in), storage (maintaining it), and retrieval
(getting it out).
Encoding involves forming a memory code. For
example, when you form a memory code for a word,
you might emphasize how it looks, how it sounds, or
what it means. Encoding usually requires attention.
Storage involves maintaining encoded information
in memory over time. Psychologists have focused
much of their memory research on trying to identify
just what factors help or hinder memory storage.
Information storage isn’t enough to guarantee
that you’ll remember something. You need to be able
to get information out of storage. Retrieval involves
recovering information from memory stores.
Research issues concerned with retrieval include the
study of how people search memory and why some
retrieval strategies are more effective than others.
Most of this chapter is devoted to an examination of memory encoding, storage, and retrieval.
As you’ll see, these basic processes help explain the
ultimate puzzle in the study of memory: why people
forget. Just as memory involves more than storage,
forgetting involves more than “losing” something
from the memory store. Forgetting may be due to
deficiencies in any of the three key processes in
memory—encoding, storage, or retrieval. After our
discussion of forgetting, we will take a brief look at
the physiological bases of memory. Finally, we will
discuss the theoretical controversy about whether
there are separate memory systems for different types
of information. The chapter’s Personal Application
provides some practical advice on how to improve
your memory. The Critical Thinking Application discusses some reasons why memory is less reliable than
people assume it to be.
We began this introductory section discussing
the concept of time travel. It is of interest to psychologists not only because it seems to be tied up
with our memory system, but also because it has
been suggested that the ability to imagine oneself in
the future gives us an adaptive advantage in terms
of our flexibility in dealing with novel situations
(Quoidbach et al., 2009; Suddendorf & Corballis,
2007). It has also been found that specific types
of future mental time travel may help increase our
happiness and reduce our stress (Quoidbach et al.,
2009). Oh yes, we almost forgot: Hermione used a
Time Turner in order to be able to attend more classes
than she had time for. The use of the Time Turner also
allowed for the rescue of Sirius Black and Buckbeak
(a hippogriff).

attention and depth of
processing in memory.
• Explain how elaboration, visual imagery,
and motivation to

encoding.
KEY LEARNING GOALS
attention were distributed equally among all stimulus inputs, life would be utter chaos. You need to
screen out most of the potential stimulation around
you in order to read a book, converse with a friend,
or even carry on a coherent train of thought.
Attention is often likened to a filter that screens
out most potential stimuli while allowing a select few
to pass through into conscious awareness. However,
a great deal of debate has been devoted to where the
filter is located in the information-processing system.
The key issue in this debate is whether stimuli are
screened out early, during sensory input, or late, after
the brain has processed the meaning or significance
of the input (see Figure 7.1).
Evidence on the “cocktail party phenomenon”
suggests the latter. For example, imagine a young
woman named Tamara at a crowded party where
many conversations are taking place. Tamara is
paying attention to her conversation with a friend
and filtering out the other conversations. However,

memory performance are seen (Naveh-Benjamin
et al., 2014).
Although people tend to believe that they can
multitask with no deterioration in performance
(Dindar & Akbulut, 2016), research suggests that the
human brain can effectively handle only one attention-consuming task at a time (Lien et al., 2006).
When people multitask, they are really switching
their attention back and forth among tasks, rather
than processing them simultaneously. That may be
fine in many circumstances, but the cost of divided
attention does have profound implications for the
advisability of driving while conversing on a cellphone, for example. Carefully controlled research
clearly demonstrates that cellphone conversations
undermine people’s driving performance, even when
hands-free phones are used (Chen & Yan, 2013; Li
et al., 2016; Strayer et al., 2006).
Unfortunately, the distractions of cellphone conversations also reduce individuals’ appreciation of
how poorly they are driving (Sanbonmatsu et al.,
2016). Many people rationalize their cellphone use
while driving by asserting that it enhances their
productivity, but research indicates that their multitasking undermines not only their driving, but
also their recall of their auto-based conversations,
leading to memory errors that may actually decrease
productivity (Watson et al., 2016). As distracting as
cellphone conversations are, research indicates that
texting while driving is even more dangerous (Caird
et al., 2014; Rumschlag et al., 2015).
There is some variability in how well people can
juggle multiple tasks. However, people generally
are not very accurate in predicting the degree to
which multitasking will impair their performance
(Calderwood et al., 2016). And those who report
that they engage in more multitasking tend to be
those who are least able to juggle multiple tasks
(Sanbonmatsu et al., 2013). As you might guess,
the data on multitasking and academic performance are not encouraging, as high levels of chronic
multitasking have been linked to poor performance
on classroom tests (Patterson, 2017), as well as standardized achievement tests in math and English
(Cain et al., 2016).
Levels of Processing
Attention is critical to the encoding of memories.
But not all attention is created equal. You can attend
to things in different ways, focusing on different
aspects of the stimulus input. According to some theorists, differences in how people attend to information are the main factors influencing how much they
remember. Fergus Craik and Robert Lockhart (1972),
both at the University of Toronto, proposed an
if someone in another conversation mentions her
name, Tamara may notice it, even though she has
been ignoring that conversation. In experimental
simulations of this situation, about 35 percent of
participants report hearing their own name (Wood
& Cowan, 1995). If selection is early, how can these
people register input they’ve been blocking out? This
cocktail party phenomenon suggests that attention
involves late selection, based on the meaning of input.
Which view is supported by the weight of scientific evidence—early selection or late selection?
Studies have found ample evidence for both as well
as for intermediate selection (Cowan, 1988; Treisman
2009). These findings have led some theorists to conclude that the location of the attention filter may be
flexible rather than fixed (Shiffrin, 1988).
The importance of attention to memory is
apparent when participants are asked to focus
their attention on two or more inputs simultaneously. Studies indicate that when participants are
forced to divide their attention between memory
encoding and some other task, large reductions in

Models of selective attention. Early-selection models propose that input is filtered before meaning
is processed. Late-selection models hold that filtering occurs after the processing of meaning. There is
evidence to support early, late, and intermediate selection, suggesting that the location of the attentional filter may not be fixed. (Based on data from MacMillan et al., 1997)

memory codes. There are other dimensions to
encoding, dimensions that can enrich the encoding
process and thereby improve memory (Nairne et al.,
2008): elaboration, visual imagery, and self-referent
coding.
ELABORATION
Semantic encoding can often be enhanced through
a process called elaboration. Elaboration is linking
a stimulus to other information at the time of
encoding. For example, let’s say you read that phobias are often caused by classical conditioning, and
you apply this idea to your own fear of spiders. In
doing so, you are engaging in elaboration. The additional associations created by elaboration usually
help people to remember information. Differences
important model in this area. In their formulation,
they argue that different rates of forgetting occur
because some methods of encoding create more
durable memory codes than others (Craik, 2020).
Craik and Lockhart propose that incoming information can be processed at different levels. For
instance, they maintain that in dealing with verbal
information, people engage in three progressively
deeper levels of processing: structural, phonemic, and
semantic encoding (see Figure 7.2). Structural encoding
is relatively shallow processing that emphasizes the
physical structure of the stimulus. For example, if
words are flashed on a screen, structural encoding
registers such matters as how they were printed (capital letters, lowercase, and so on) or the length of the
words (how many letters). Further analysis may result
in phonemic encoding, which emphasizes what a word
sounds like. Phonemic encoding involves naming or
saying (perhaps silently) the words. Finally, semantic
encoding emphasizes the meaning of verbal input; it
involves thinking about the objects and actions the
words represent. Levels-of-processing theory proposes
that deeper levels of processing result in longerlasting memory codes.
In one experimental test of levels-of-processing
theory, Craik and Tulving (1975) compared the
durability of structural, phonemic, and semantic
encoding. They directed participants’ attention to
particular aspects of briefly presented stimulus words
by asking them questions about various characteristics of the words (see Figure 7.2). The questions
were designed to engage the participants in different
levels of processing. The key hypothesis was that
retention of the stimulus words would increase as
participants moved from structural to phonemic to
semantic encoding. After responding to 60 words,
the participants received an unexpected test of
their memory for the words. As predicted, the participants’ recall was low after structural encoding,
notably better after phonemic encoding, and highest
after semantic encoding (see Figure 7.3). While the
theory is not without its critics, the hypothesis that
deeper processing leads to enhanced memory has
been replicated in many studies (Baddeley & Hitch,
2017; Craik, 2002; Lockhart & Craik, 1990). Levelsof-processing theory has been enormously influential; it has shown that memory involves more than
just storage and has inspired a great deal of research
on how processing considerations affect memory
(Arkes, 2016; Craik, 2020; Nunoi & Yoshikawa, 2016;
Roediger et al., 2002).

more durable memories.

and Kirker (1977). Like Craik and Tulving (1975),
these researchers manipulated encoding by asking
the participants certain kinds of questions. To induce
self-referent encoding, participants were asked
to decide whether adjectives flashed on a screen
applied to them personally. The results showed
that self-referent encoding led to improved recall
of the adjectives. Self-referent encoding appears to
enhance recall by promoting additional elaboration
and better organization of information (Symons &
Johnson, 1997). The implications of self-referent
encoding for understanding autism are explored in
our first Featured Study.

in elaboration can help explain why different
approaches to semantic processing result in varied
amounts of retention (Craik & Tulving, 1975).
VISUAL IMAGERY
Imagery—the creation of visual images to represent
the words to be remembered—can also be used to
enrich encoding. Of course, some words are easier
to create images for than others. If you were asked
to remember the word juggler, you could readily
form an image of someone juggling balls. However,
if you were asked to remember the word truth, you
would probably have more difficulty forming a suitable image. The difference is that juggler refers to a
concrete object, whereas truth refers to an abstract
concept. Allan Paivio (1969, 2007) points out that it
is easier to form images of concrete objects than of
abstract concepts. He believes that this ease of image
formation affects memory.
The beneficial effect of imagery on memory was
demonstrated in a study by Paivio, Smythe, and Yuille
(1968). They asked participants to learn a list of 16
pairs of words. They manipulated whether the words
were concrete, high-imagery words, or abstract,
low-imagery words. In terms of imagery potential,
the list contained four types of pairings: high–
high (juggler–dress), high–low (letter–effort), low–
high (duty–hotel), and low–low (quality–necessity).
Figure 7.4 shows the recall for each type of pairing.
The impact of imagery is quite evident. The best
recall was of high–high pairings, and the worst recall
was of low–low pairings, showing that high-imagery
words are easier to remember than low-imagery
words. Similar results were observed in another
study that controlled for additional confounding
factors (Paivio et al., 2000).
According to Paivio (1986), imagery facilitates memory because it provides a second kind of
memory code, and two codes are better than one. His
dual-coding theory holds that memory is enhanced
by forming semantic and visual codes, since either
can lead to recall. Although some aspects of dualcoding theory have been questioned, it’s clear that
the use of mental imagery can enhance memory in
many situations (Marschark, 1992; McCauley et al.,
1996).
SELF-REFERENT ENCODING
Making material personally relevant can also enrich
encoding (Hamami et al., 2011). Self-referent
encoding involves deciding how or whether information is personally relevant. This approach to
encoding was compared to structural, phonemic,
and semantic encoding in a study by Rogers, Kuiper,

Human Memory 259
Sensory Memory
The sensory memory preserves information in its
original sensory form for a brief time, usually only
a fraction of a second. Sensory memory allows the
sensation of a visual pattern, sound, or touch to linger
for a brief moment after the sensory stimulation is
over. In effect, people can react to the stimulus for a
brief period of time as if the stimulus was still present
(McBurney & Collings, 1984). In the case of vision,
people really perceive an afterimage rather than the
actual stimulus. You can demonstrate the existence of
afterimages for yourself by rapidly moving a lighted
sparkler or flashlight in circles in the dark. If you move
a sparkler fast enough, you should see a complete circle
even though the light source is only a single point.
The sensory memory preserves the sensory image long
enough for you to perceive a continuous circle rather
than separate points of light. The memory is brief but
can be extremely useful in reacting to changing situations. For visual information, this brief memory is
referred to as iconic memory. The parallel memory for
acoustic information is referred to as echoic memory.
In each case, the memory is a brief representation of a
visual sensory or acoustic sensory stimulus.
The brief preservation of sensations in sensory
memory gives you additional time to try to recognize
stimuli. However, you’d better take advantage of sensory storage immediately because it doesn’t last long.
This fact was demonstrated in a classic experiment
by George Sperling (1960). The participants saw
three rows of letters flashed on a screen for just 1/20
of a second. A tone following the exposure signalled
Storage: Maintaining Information in Memory
In their efforts to understand memory storage, theorists have historically related it to the technologies of
their age (Roediger, 1980). One of the earliest models
used to explain memory storage was the wax tablet.
Both Aristotle and Plato compared memory to a
block of wax that differed in size and hardness for
various individuals. Remembering, according to this
analogy, was like stamping an impression into the
wax. As long as the image remained in the wax, the
memory would remain intact.
Modern theories of memory reflect the technological advances of the 20th century. For example,
many theories formulated at the dawn of the computer age drew an analogy between information
storage by computers and information storage in
human memory (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968, 1971;
Broadbent, 1958; Waugh & Norman, 1965). The
main contribution of these information-processing
theories was to subdivide memory into three separate
memory stores (Estes, 1999; Pashler & Carrier, 1996).
The names for these stores and their exact characteristics varied some from one theory to the next.
For purposes of simplicity, we’ll organize our discussion around the model devised by Richard Atkinson
and Richard Shiffrin, which proved to be the most
influential of the information-processing theories
(e.g., Lehman & Malmberg, 2013). According to their
model, incoming information passes through two
temporary storage buffers—the sensory store and
short-term store—before it is transferred into a longterm store (see Figure 7.5). Like the wax tablet before
it, the information-processing model of memory is a
metaphor; the three memory stores are not viewed
as anatomical structures in the brain, but rather as
functionally distinct types of memory.

Figure 7.5
The Atkinson and Shiffrin model of memory storage. Atkinson and Shiffrin (1971) proposed
that memory is made up of three information stores. Sensory memory can hold a large amount of
information just long enough (a fraction of a second) for a small portion of it to be selected for longer
storage. Short-term memory has a limited capacity, and unless aided by rehearsal, its storage duration
is brief. Long-term memory can store an apparently unlimited amount of information for indeterminate
periods.
Because the image of the sparkler persists briefly in sensory memory, when the sparkler is moved fast enough, the
blending of afterimages causes people to see a continuous
stream of light instead of a succession of individual points.

260 CHAPTER 7
DURABILITY OF STORAGE
Without rehearsal, information in short-term
memory is lost in less than 20 seconds (Nairne, 2003;
Wickens, 1999). This rapid loss was demonstrated
in a study by Peterson and Peterson (1959). They
measured how long undergraduates could remember
three consonants if they couldn’t rehearse them. To
prevent rehearsal, the Petersons required the students to count backward by threes from the time
the consonants were presented until they saw a light
that signalled the recall test (see Figure 7.7). Their
results showed that participants’ recall accuracy was
pretty dismal (about 10 percent) after only 15 seconds. Other approaches to the issue have suggested
that the typical duration of STM storage may even be
shorter (Baddeley, 1986).
CAPACITY OF STORAGE
Short-term memory is also limited in the number
of items it can hold. The small capacity of STM was
pointed out by George Miller (1956) in a famous paper
called “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus
Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing
Information.” Miller noticed that people could recall
only about seven items in tasks that required them to
remember unfamiliar material. The common thread
in these tasks, Miller argued, was that they required
the use of STM. The limited capacity of STM constrains people’s ability to perform tasks in which they
need to mentally juggle various pieces of information (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974).
The capacity of short-term memory may even
be less than widely assumed. Nelson Cowan (2005,
2010) cites evidence indicating that the capacity of
which row of letters the participant should report to
the experimenter (see Figure 7.6). Participants were
fairly accurate when the signal occurred immediately. However, their accuracy steadily declined as
the delay of the tone increased to one second. Why?
Because the memory trace in the visual sensory store
decays in about 1/4 of a second. Memory traces in
the auditory sensory store also appear to last less
than a second (Massaro & Loftus, 1996). While very
brief, these sensory memories are clearly important
affecting, among other things, the richness of our
visual perception, the accuracy of our construal of our
world, and the decisions we make (Vandenbrouke et
al., 2014; Vlassova & Pearson, 2013).
Short-Term Memory
Short-term memory (STM) is a limited-capacity store
that can maintain unrehearsed information for up
to about 20 seconds. In contrast, information stored
in long-term memory may last weeks, months, or
years. However, there is a way that you can maintain
information in your short-term store indefinitely.
How? Primarily, by engaging in rehearsal—the process of repetitively verbalizing or thinking about
the information. Cognitive psychologists often distinguish between maintenance rehearsal and more
elaborative rehearsal or processing (e.g., Craik &
Lockhart, 1972). In using maintenance rehearsal
you are simply maintaining the information in consciousness, whereas in more elaborative processing,
you are increasing the probability that you will retain
the information in the future (Brown & Craik, 2000)
by, for example, focusing on the meaning of the
words in the list you are trying to remember.

or chunks. But a string of 14 letters is too long for
STM, so errors are likely. Now present the same string
of letters to another person, but place the pauses in
the following locations:
ESPN - NETFLIX - IBM
The letters now form three familiar chunks that
should occupy only three slots in STM, resulting in
successful recall (Bower & Springston, 1970).
To successfully chunk the letters N E T F L I X,
one must first recognize these letters as a familiar
unit. This familiarity has to be stored somewhere in
long-term memory. In one recent study, participants’
familiarity with various chunks—pairs of Chinese
characters—was manipulated to explore the effects
of high versus low familiarity (Reder et al., 2016).
Participants were asked to memorize associations
between pairs of Chinese characters (differing in
familiarity due to pretraining) and arbitrary English
words and then took several weekly recall tests.
Participants exhibited better memory for associations built on more familiar chunks. The researchers
conclude that familiar chunks consume less of the
limited capacity of STM than unfamiliar chunks.
This finding is consistent with a new line of thought
asserting that the storage capacity of STM may be
somewhat flexible rather than fixed, depending on
the familiarity and complexity of the stimuli (Brady
et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2014; Taylor et al., 2017).
Individuals who are experts in specific areas have
been shown to process and remember information related to that expertise differently than nonexperts (e.g., Guida & Campitelli, 2019). This was
STM might be even lower—four plus or minus one.
The consensus on the capacity of STM seems to be
moving toward this smaller estimate (Cowan, 2014,
2015; Lustig et al., 2009). According to Cowan, the
capacity of STM has historically been overestimated
because researchers have often failed to take steps to
prevent covert rehearsal or chunking by participants.
It has long been known that you can increase the
capacity of your short-term memory by combining
stimuli into larger, possibly higher-order units, called
chunks (Simon, 1974). A chunk is a group of familiar
stimuli stored as a single unit. You can demonstrate
the effect of chunking by asking someone to recall a
sequence of 12 letters grouped in the following way:

Calling this assertion a misconception is a little harsh,
as it has been the conventional wisdom since the
1950s and there is room for argument on the matter.
However, in the last decade or so, researchers using
more sophisticated methods have been chipping
away at this maxim. The consensus among memory
experts has shifted toward the belief that the capacity
of STM is four plus or minus one.

phone number. Baddeley (2003; Repovš & Baddeley,
2006) believes that the phonological loop evolved
to facilitate the acquisition of language. The second
component in working memory is a visuospatial
sketchpad that permits people to temporarily hold
and manipulate visual images. This element is at
work when you try to mentally rearrange the furniture in your bedroom or map out a complicated route
that you need to follow to travel somewhere.
The third component is a central executive system.
It controls the deployment of attention, switching the
focus of attention and dividing attention as needed
(e.g., dividing your attention between a message you
are trying to text to your friend during a lecture and
what your professor told the class about next week’s
exam, “What was that? Which chapters are on next
week’s exam?”). The central executive also coordinates the actions of the other modules. The fourth
component is the episodic buffer, a temporary, limitedcapacity store that allows the various components
of working memory to integrate information and
that serves as an interface between working memory
and long-term memory. The two key characteristics
that originally defined short-term memory—limited
capacity and storage duration—are still present in the
concept of working memory, but Baddeley’s model
accounts for evidence that STM handles a greater
variety of functions than previously thought.
Baddeley’s model of working memory has generated an enormous volume of research (Courtney,
2004; Theeuwes et al., 2009). For example, one
line of research has shown that people vary in how
well they can juggle information in their working
memory while fending off distractions (Engle, 2001).
Working memory capacity (WMC) refers to one’s
ability to hold and manipulate information in
conscious attention. Working memory capacity is a
stable personal trait (Unsworth, 2016) that appears
to be influenced to a considerable degree by heredity
(Kremen et al., 2007). That said, working memory
capacity can be temporarily reduced by situational
factors, such as pressure to perform or rumination
(Curci et al., 2013; Moran, 2016).
Variations in working memory capacity correlate
positively with measures of high-level cognitive
abilities, such as reading comprehension, complex reasoning, and even intelligence (Logie, 2011;
Chuderski, 2015). This finding has led some theorists
to conclude that working memory capacity is critical
to complex cognition (Lepine et al., 2005).
Long-Term Memory
Long-term memory (LTM) is an unlimited capacity
store that can hold information over lengthy
periods of time. Unlike sensory and short-term
demonstrated by William Chase and the 1978 Nobel
Prize winner Herbert Simon, when they studied how
expert and novice chess players remembered the
positions of chess pieces on a chessboard after having
a chance to look at the board for only a few seconds
(Chase & Simon, 1973). Chase and Simon (1973) suggested that the experts “chunked” the information
differently and more effectively. But this advantage
holds only when the chess pieces appear in meaningful and familiar patterns. In this case, the expert’s
advantage lies in the ability to “encode the position
into larger perceptual chunks, each consisting of a
familiar subconfiguration of pieces” (p. 80).
SHORT-TERM MEMORY AS
“WORKING MEMORY”
Research eventually suggested that short-term memory
involves more than a simple rehearsal buffer, as originally envisioned. To make sense of such findings, Alan
Baddeley (1986, 1989, 1992) proposed a more complex,
modularized model of short-term memory that characterizes it as “working memory.” According to Baddeley
(2003), working memory is a limited capacity storage
system that temporarily maintains and stores information by providing an interface between perception, memory, and action. Since its introduction, the
concept of “working memory” has proven invaluable
in our attempts to understand human behaviour and
experience (e.g., Baddeley, 2012; Bae & Flombaum,
2013; Biderman et al., 2019; Camos, 2015; Rose et al.,
2012; Sims et al., 2012). While the term was first used
by Miller, Galanter, and Pribaum (1960), it is Baddeley’s
model that has been most influential.
Baddeley’s model of working memory consists of
four components (see Figure 7.8). The first component is the phonological loop that represented all of
STM in earlier models. This component is at work

York City and Washington, DC; or the first death in
their community related to the COVID-19 pandemic
in 2020 (Government of Canada, 2020a). Although
flashbulb memories have mostly been studied in relation to negative events, people also report flashbulb
memories of positive events (Kraha & Boals, 2014).
For example, Tinti and colleagues (2014) studied
flashbulb memories in Italian citizens after Italy won
the World Cup in 2006.
Does the evidence on flashbulb memories provide
adequate support for the idea that long-term memory
storage is permanent? No, research eventually showed
that flashbulb memories are perhaps neither as accurate nor as special as once believed (Hirst & Phelps,
2016; Hirst et al., 2009; Schmolck et al., 2000). Like
other memories, they become less detailed and complete with time and are often inaccurate (Talarico &
Rubin, 2009). That said, a ten-year follow-up on individuals’ flashbulb memories for their learning about
the 9/11 attacks found little erosion of memory after
the first three years (Hirst et al., 2015). Still, the data
yielded estimates that people’s flashbulb memories
were only about 60 percent accurate. Research suggests that it is not extraordinary accuracy or longevity that distinguish flashbulb memories. Rather,
what makes them special is that people subjectively
feel that these memories are so exceptionally vivid
that they have exceptional confidence (albeit misplaced) in their memories’ accuracy, and that more
emotional intensity is attached to these recollections
(Hirst & Phelps, 2016; Talarico & Rubin, 2003, 2007).
We know that factors such as emotion can dramatically facilitate memory (Kensinger & Ford, 2020). So,
perhaps flashbulb memories are “special” but not in
the way originally envisioned.
Returning to the question at hand, the research
findings on flashbulb memories conflict with the
hypothesis that memory storage is permanent.
Although the possibility cannot be ruled out completely, there is still no convincing evidence that
memories are stored away permanently and that
memory, which have very brief storage durations,
LTM can store information indefinitely. In fact, one
point of view is that all information stored in longterm memory is stored there permanently. According
to this view, forgetting occurs only because people
sometimes cannot retrieve needed information from
LTM.
The notion that LTM storage may be permanent is
certainly intriguing. A couple of interesting lines of
research have seemed to provide compelling evidence
of permanent storage. However, each line of research
turns out to be less compelling than it appears at first
glance. The first line of research consisted of some
landmark studies conducted by neuroscientist Wilder
Penfield at McGill University. He reported triggering
long-lost memories through electrical stimulation
of the brain (ESB) during brain surgeries (Penfield &
Perot, 1963). When Penfield used ESB to map brain
function in patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy,
he found that stimulation of the temporal lobe sometimes elicited vivid descriptions of events long past.
Patients would describe events that apparently came
from their childhood—such as “being in a lumberyard” or “watching Mom make a phone call”—as
if they were there once again. Penfield and others
inferred that these descriptions were exact playbacks
of long-lost memories unearthed by electrical stimulation of the brain.
The existence of flashbulb memories is one piece of
evidence that has been cited to support the notion
that long-term memory storage may be permanent. At first glance, flashbulb memories, which are
thought to be unusually vivid and detailed recollections of momentous events, provide striking examples of seemingly permanent storage (Brown & Kulik,
1977). Many adults, for instance, can remember
exactly where they were, what they were doing,
and how they felt when they learned of the death
of a favourite celebrity such as musicians Prince or
David Bowie, both in 2016; or traumatic events such
as the 2001 terrorist attacks that took place in New
Flashbulb memories are
vivid and detailed recollections of momentous
events. For example, many
people will long remember
exactly where they were
and how they felt when
they learned about the terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center.

264 CHAPTER 7
memory storage: How is knowledge represented
and organized in memory? In other words, what
forms do our mental representations of information
take? Most theorists seem to agree that our mental
representations probably take a variety of forms,
depending on the nature of the material that needs
to be tucked away in memory. Most of the theorizing
to date has focused on how factual information may
be represented in memory. In this section, we’ll look
at a small sample of the organizational structures
that have been proposed for semantic information.
CATEGORIES AND CONCEPTUAL
HIERARCHIES
People spontaneously organize information into
categories for storage in memory. This reality was
apparent in a study by Bousfield (1953), who asked
participants to memorize a list of 60 words. Although
presented in a scrambled order, each of the words
in the list fits into one of four categories: animals,
men’s names, vegetables, or professions. Bousfield
showed that participants recalling this list engage
in clustering—the tendency to remember similar or
related items in groups. Even though the words were
not presented in organized groups, participants tended
to remember them in bunches that belonged in the
same category. Thus, when applicable, factual information is routinely organized into simple categories.
Factual information is routinely represented in
categories, and when possible, this information is
organized into conceptual hierarchies. A conceptual
hierarchy is a multilevel classification system based
on common properties among items. A conceptual
hierarchy that a person might construct for minerals
can be found in Figure 7.9. According to Gordon
Bower (1970), organizing information into a conceptual hierarchy can improve recall dramatically.
SCHEMAS
Imagine that you’ve just visited your psychology professor’s office, which is shown in the photo on this
page. Take a brief look at the photo and then cover
it up. Now pretend that you want to describe your
professor’s office to a friend. Write down what you
saw in the picture of the office.
After you finish, compare your description with
the picture. Chances are, your description will
include elements—books or filing cabinets, for
instance—that were not in the office. This common
phenomenon demonstrates how schemas can influence memory.
A schema is an organized cluster of knowledge
about a particular object or event abstracted from
previous experience with the object or event. For
example, university students have schemas for what
forgetting is all a matter of retrieval failure (Payne &
Blackwell, 1998; Schacter, 1996).

Semantic networks have proven useful in
explaining why thinking about one word (such
as butter) can make a closely related word (such as
bread) easier to remember (Meyer & Schvaneveldt,
1976). According to Collins and Loftus (1975), when
people think about a word, their thoughts naturally
go to related words. These theorists call this process
spreading activation within a semantic network. They
assume that activation spreads out along the pathways of the semantic network surrounding the word.
They also theorize that the strength of this activation decreases as it travels outward, much as ripples
decrease in size as they radiate outward from a rock
tossed into a pond. Consider again the semantic network shown in Figure 7.10. If participants see the
word red, words that are closely linked to it (such
as orange) should be easier to recall than words that
have longer links (such as sunrises).

professors’ offices are like. When Brewer and Treyens
(1981) tested the recall of 30 participants who had
briefly visited the office shown in the photo on
page 264, most participants recalled the desks and
chairs, but few recalled the wine bottle or the picnic
basket, which aren’t part of a typical office schema.
Moreover, nine participants in the Brewer and
Treyens study falsely recalled that the office contained books. Perhaps you made the same mistake.
These results and other studies (Tuckey & Brewer,
2003; Yamada & Itsukima, 2013) suggest that people
are more likely to remember things that are consistent
with their schemas than things that are not. Although
this principle seems applicable much of the time,
the inverse is also true: People sometimes exhibit better
recall of things that violate their schema-based expectations (Koriat et al., 2000; Neuschatz et al., 2002).
Information that really clashes with a schema may
attract extra attention and deeper processing and
thus become more memorable. For instance, if you
saw a slot machine in a professor’s office, you would
probably remember it. In either case, it’s apparent
that information stored in memory is often organized around schemas (Brewer, 2000).
SEMANTIC NETWORKS
Of course, not all information fits neatly into conceptual hierarchies or schemas. Much knowledge
seems to be organized into less systematic frameworks, called semantic networks (Collins & Loftus,
1975). A semantic network consists of nodes representing concepts, joined together by pathways
that link related concepts. A small semantic network is shown in Figure 7.10. The ovals are the
nodes, and the words inside the ovals are the interlinked concepts. The lines connecting the nodes
are the pathways. A more detailed figure would
label the pathways to show how the concepts are
related to one another. However, in this instance,
the relationships should be fairly clear. The length
of each pathway represents the degree of association between two concepts. Shorter pathways imply
stronger associations.
Retrieval: Getting Information Out of Memory
Entering information into long-term memory is
a worthy goal, but an insufficient one if you can’t
get the information back out again when you need
it. Some theorists maintain that understanding
retrieval is the key to understanding human memory
(Roediger, 2000). Understanding retrieval may also
be important to success in your studies and especially
your exam performance. When you study for your
exams, you are attempting to encode the information in such a way that it is stored in your long-term
memory so that it will be there when you need it.
As most of us know, however, we don’t get all of the
questions correct. What does this indicate? Tulving
distinguished between the availability and accessibility
of information in memory (Tulving & Pearlstone,
1966). You might not be able to answer a particular

266 CHAPTER 7
have experienced the effects of context cues on
many occasions. For instance, when people return
after a number of years to a place where they used to
live, they typically are flooded with long-forgotten
memories. Or consider how often you have gone
from one room to another to get something (scissors,
perhaps), only to discover that you can’t remember
what you were after. However, when you return to
the first room (the original context), you suddenly
recall what it was (“Of course, the scissors!”). These
examples illustrate the potentially powerful effects of
context cues on memory.
The value of reinstating the context of an event
may account for how hypnosis occasionally stimulates eyewitness recall in legal investigations (Meyer,
1992). The hypnotist usually attempts to reinstate
the context of the event by telling the witness to
imagine being at the scene of the crime once again.
Although it is widely believed by the general public
that hypnosis can help people remember things that
they would not normally recall (Simons & Chabris,
2011), extensive research has failed to demonstrate
that hypnosis can reliably enhance retrieval (Wagstaff
& Wheatcroft, 2017). Quite to the contrary, research
suggests that hypnosis often increases individuals’
tendency to report incorrect information (Mazzoni et
al., 2014).
Reconstructing Memories
One survey on people’s notions about memory
found that 63 percent believe that when you retrieve
information from long-term memory, you’re able to
pull up a “mental videotape” that provides an exact
replay of the past (Simons & Chabris, 2011). However,
countless studies have demonstrated that this is an
inaccurate view of memory. This was shown many
years ago by Sir Frederick Bartlett (1932), a prominent psychologist at Cambridge University. His work
highlighted the reconstructive nature of memory. In
reality, all memories are reconstructions of the past
question because the information is unavailable (no
longer present in the memory system) or because it
is not accessible (present in the system but not accessible to you at the moment). The information may
not be accessible because the cues you are using in
your attempt to answer the question are not effective. The cue-dependent nature of memory is a key
assumption of most of the major models of memory
retrieval; these include those models focusing on
context as a cue, dual storage models, models of
chunking, and others (Kahana, 2020).
Using Cues to Aid Retrieval
The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon—the temporary inability to remember something you know,
accompanied by a feeling that it’s just out of
reach—is a common experience that is typically
triggered by a name that one can’t quite recall. The
tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon is a universal experience that is seen across highly varied languages
and cultures. It is also a common experience that
happens about once a week, although its occurrence increases with age (Schwartz & Metcalfe,
2014). About 40 percent of people report recurrent tip-of-the-tongue experiences for the same
words (Brown & Caderao, 2014). A sizable portion
of tip-of-the-tongue experiences involve the failure
to recall people’s names (Hanley, 2014). The tipof-the-tongue phenomenon clearly represents a
failure in retrieval. However, the exact mechanisms
underlying this failure are the subject of debate
(Schwartz & Metcalfe, 2014).
Fortunately, memories can often be jogged with
retrieval cues—stimuli that help gain access to memories. This was apparent when Roger Brown and
David McNeill (1966) studied the tip-of-the-tongue
phenomenon. They gave participants definitions of
obscure words and asked them to come up with the
words. Brown and McNeill found that participants
groping for obscure words were correct in guessing
the first letter of the missing word 57 percent of the
time. This figure far exceeds chance and shows that
partial recollections are often headed in the right
direction.
Reinstating the Context of an Event
Let’s test your memory: What did you have for breakfast two days ago? If you can’t immediately answer,
you might begin by imagining yourself sitting at the
breakfast table. Trying to recall an event by putting
yourself back into the context in which it occurred
involves working with context cues to aid retrieval
(Tulving & Thomson, 1973).
Context cues often facilitate the retrieval of information (Hanczakowski et al., 2014). Most people

light bulb. These are facts that most people have
encountered repeatedly. They should be stable
memories that ought to be resistant to change.
But, consider what happened when Fazio and
colleagues (2013) had participants read short fictional stories that contradicted these facts by casually mentioning that the Atlantic was the largest
ocean and that Benjamin Franklin invented the
light bulb. Although the participants had shown
correct knowledge of these and other well-known
facts two weeks earlier, when they took a test of
general knowledge after reading misleading stories,
about 20 percent got basic facts wrong—such as
indicating that Franklin invented the light bulb—
even though they were explicitly warned that the
fictional stories might contain factual errors. Thus,
in a portion of participants, a single, brief exposure
to misinformation disrupted basic factual knowledge. Sorry to say, these findings suggest that just
reading about this study might distort your own
future recall of these simple facts.
Other research on the reconstructive nature of
memory has demonstrated that the simple act of
retelling a story can introduce inaccuracies into
memory (Marsh, 2007). When people retell a story,
they may streamline it, embellish the facts, exaggerate their role, and so forth. In such retellings,
people may be aware that they are being a little loose
with the facts (Marsh & Tversky, 2004). However,
what is interesting is that their intentional distortions can reshape their subsequent recollections of
the same events. Somehow, the “real” story and the
storyteller’s “spin” on it begin to blend imperceptibly. So, even routine retellings of events can contribute to the malleability of memory.
(Krackow et al., 2019; Maswood & Rajaram, 2019)
that may be distorted and may include details that
did not actually occur (Pickrell et al., 2017; Schacter
& Loftus, 2013).
Research by Elizabeth Loftus (1979, 1992, 2005,
2018) and others on the misinformation effect has
shown that reconstructive distortions show up frequently in eyewitness testimony. The misinformation effect occurs when participants’ recall of an
event they witnessed is altered by introducing misleading post-event information. For example, in one
study, Loftus and Palmer (1974) showed participants
a videotape of an automobile accident. Participants
were then “grilled” as if they were providing eyewitness testimony, and biasing information was introduced. Some participants were asked, “How fast were
the cars going when they hit each other?” Others
were asked, “How fast were the cars going when they
smashed into each other?” A week later, participants’
recall of the accident was tested. They were asked
whether they remembered seeing any broken glass in
the accident (there was none). Those who had earlier
been asked about the cars smashing into each other
were more likely to “recall” broken glass. Why would
they add this detail to their reconstructions of the
accident? Probably because broken glass is consistent
with their schemas for cars smashing together (see
Figure 7.11).
The misinformation effect, which has been replicated in countless studies (Frenda et al., 2011), is a
remarkably reliable phenomenon that “challenged
prevailing views about the validity of memory”
(Zaragoza et al., 2007, p. 37). Indeed, the effect is so
difficult to escape that even participants who have
been forewarned can be swayed by post-event misinformation (Chrobak & Zaragoza, 2013). Moreover,
memory distortions can even be seen when the
post-event misinformation involves altering participants’ own memory reports. In a study by Cochran
and colleagues (2016), participants viewed a short
slideshow depicting a theft of a wallet and answered
questions about the incident. Participants were
subsequently exposed to versions of their original
memory reports in which several details had been
altered. Most did not notice the alterations, and a
subsequent memory assessment revealed that their
memories tended to shift to be more consistent with
the altered reports.
In addition, studies have demonstrated that the
influence of misinformation is not limited to memories of events that one has personally experienced
or witnessed; it can also distort one’s knowledge of
basic facts (Bottoms et al., 2010). For example, most
people know that the Pacific is the largest ocean
on Earth and that Thomas Edison invented the

not tagged with labels that specify their sources.
Thus, when people pull up specific memory records,
they have to make decisions at the time of retrieval
about where the memories came from (e.g., “Did I
read that in the New York Times or the Peterborough
Examiner”?). A source-monitoring error occurs when
a memory derived from one source is misattributed
to another source. Inaccurate memories that reflect
source-monitoring errors can seem quite compelling
(Kuhlmann & Bayen, 2016). People often feel quite
confident about the authenticity of their assertions
even though the recollections really are inaccurate
(Lampinen et al., 1999).
Source-monitoring errors appear to be commonplace and may shed light on many interesting
memory phenomena. For instance, in studies of eyewitness suggestibility, some participants have gone
so far as to insist that they “remember” seeing something that was only verbally suggested to them. Most
theories have a hard time explaining how people can
have memories of events that they never actually
saw or experienced. But this paradox doesn’t seem
all that perplexing when it is explained as a sourcemonitoring error (Lindsay et al., 2004).
Source Monitoring
The misinformation effect appears to be due, in
part, to the unreliability of source monitoring—the
process of making inferences about the origins
of memories. Marcia Johnson and her colleagues
(Johnson, 1996, 2006; Johnson et al., 2012) maintain that source monitoring is a crucial facet of
memory retrieval that contributes to many of the
mistakes that people make in reconstructing their
experiences. According to Johnson, memories are

Forgetting: When Memory Lapses
Our review of the literature regarding memory
clearly shows that it is a complex process, consisting
of many important characteristics. In addition, the
research shows us that our ability to “remember”
events is subject to diverse influences—some of
which promote and some of which inhibit memory.
One of the most important influences is time; our
memory declines with time. Several “time-related”
mechanisms have been implicated in this memory
decline (Biderman et al., 2019). These include,
among others, memory decay and interference. In
this section we will discuss some of the factors and
processes that have been found to inhibit our ability
to remember—processes that instead promote “forgetting.” Before that, however, we would like to
make a few observations about forgetting that highlight its potential positive side.
Forgetting gets “bad press” that it may not
deserve. People tend to view forgetting as a failure,
weakness, or deficiency in cognitive processing.
Although forgetting important information can be
extremely frustrating, some memory theorists argue
that forgetting is actually adaptive. How so? There
are at least a few ways.
Imagine how cluttered your memory would be if
you never forgot anything (Storm, 2011). According
to Daniel Schacter (1999), we need to forget
information that is no longer relevant, such as out-ofdate phone numbers, discarded passwords, lines that
were memorized for a play in Grade 10, and where
you kept your important papers three apartments
ago. Forgetting can reduce competition among memories that can cause confusion. Laney (2013) offers a
simple but compelling example. Imagine what would
happen if all your many memories of parking your
car at a nearby shopping mall were equally vivid?
Good luck finding your car! It is highly functional
if your memory of where you parked at a mall today
is much stronger than your memory of where you
parked at the same mall five days or two weeks ago.
Additionally, Norby (2015) points out that forgetting
can contribute to regulating our emotions. Think
how miserable people would be if they were unable
to forget their most embarrassing or most disappointing moments. Fortunately, most people tend to
selectively forget their faults and follies (Sedikides et
al., 2016), which is much healthier than dwelling on
them, as rumination can foster depression (NolenHoeksema, 2000).
It also has been suggested that forgetting is a necessary component of our memory processes because
it helps us, among other things, to generalize from
our experiences. Our brain may engage in “controlled forgetting” in which some specific details

Measures of Forgetting
To study forgetting empirically, psychologists need
to be able to measure it precisely. Measures of forgetting inevitably measure retention as well. Retention
refers to the proportion of material retained
(remembered). In studies of forgetting, the results
may be reported in terms of the amount forgotten
or the amount retained. In these studies, the retention
interval is the length of time between the presentation of materials to be remembered and the measurement of forgetting. The three principal methods used
to measure forgetting are recall, recognition, and
relearning (Lockhart, 1992).
Who is the current premier of Manitoba? What
movie won the Academy Award for best picture last
year? These questions involve recall measures of
retention. A recall measure of retention requires
participants to reproduce information on their own
without any cues. If you were to take a recall test on
a list of 25 words you had memorized, you would
simply be told to write down on a blank sheet of
paper as many of the words as you could remember.
In contrast, in a recognition test you might be
shown a list of 100 words and asked to choose the
25 words that you had memorized. A recognition
measure of retention requires participants to select
previously learned information from an array
of options. If you’re like most students, you probably prefer multiple-choice tests over essay tests.
This preference is understandable because evidence
shows that recognition measures tend to yield higher
scores than recall measures of memory for the same
information (Lockhart, 2000). There are two ways of
from an event, such as being bitten by a dog, are lost,
enabling us to generalize from a specific incident to
the more general, so that we can avoid being bitten
in the future (Gravitz, 2019).
Although forgetting may be adaptive in the long
run, the fundamental question of memory research
remains. There isn’t one simple answer to this question. Research has shown that forgetting can be
caused by defects in encoding, storage, retrieval, or
some combination of these processes.
How Quickly We Forget: Ebbinghaus’s
Forgetting Curve
The first person to conduct scientific studies of forgetting was Hermann Ebbinghaus. He published
a series of insightful memory studies way back
in 1885. Ebbinghaus studied only one subject—
himself. To give himself lots of new material to
memorize, he invented nonsense syllables—consonant-vowel-consonant arrangements that do not
correspond to words (such as BAF, XOF, VIR, and
MEQ). He wanted to work with meaningless materials that would be uncontaminated by his previous
learning.
Ebbinghaus was a remarkably dedicated
researcher. For instance, in one study he went
through over 14 000 practice repetitions, as he tirelessly memorized 420 lists of nonsense syllables
(Slamecka, 1985). He tested his memory of these
lists after various time intervals. Figure 7.12 shows
what he found. This diagram, called a forgetting
curve, graphs retention and forgetting over time.
Ebbinghaus’s forgetting curve shows a precipitous
drop in retention during the first few hours after the
nonsense syllables were memorized. Thus, he concluded that most forgetting occurs very rapidly after
learning something.
That’s a depressing conclusion. What is the point
of memorizing information if you’re going to forget
it all right away? Fortunately, subsequent research
showed that Ebbinghaus’s forgetting curve was
unusually steep (Postman, 1985). Forgetting isn’t
usually quite as swift or as extensive as Ebbinghaus
thought. One problem was that he was working
with such meaningless material. When participants
memorize more meaningful material, such as prose
or poetry, forgetting curves aren’t nearly as steep.
Studies of how well people recall their high school
classmates suggest that forgetting curves for autobiographical information are much shallower (Bahrick,
2000). Also, different methods of measuring forgetting yield varied estimates of how quickly people
forget. This variation underscores the importance of
the methods used to measure forgetting, the matter
we turn to next.

and then levels off. Although this generalization remains true, subsequent research has shown that
forgetting curves for nonsense syllables are unusually steep. (Data from Ebbinghaus, 1885)

270 CHAPTER 7
Why We Forget
Measuring forgetting is only the first step in the long
journey toward explaining why forgetting occurs. In
this section, we explore the possible causes of forgetting, looking at factors that may affect encoding,
storage, and retrieval processes.
INEFFECTIVE ENCODING
A great deal of forgetting may only appear to be
forgetting. The information in question may never
have been inserted into memory in the first place.
Since you can’t really forget something you never
learned, this phenomenon is sometimes called
pseudoforgetting. People usually assume that they
know what a quarter looks like, but most have actually failed to encode this information. If presented
with a picture of a real quarter and some realistic
fakes, however, most people would have difficulty
picking out the real quarter. This is a good example
of pseudoforgetting: Pseudoforgetting is usually
due to lack of attention. Although we handle them
every day, most of us do not really look at coins
closely.
Even when memory codes are formed for new
information, subsequent forgetting may be the result
of ineffective or inappropriate encoding (Brown &
Craik, 2000). The research on levels of processing
shows that some approaches to encoding lead to
more forgetting than others (Craik & Tulving, 1975).
For example, if you’re distracted while you read your
textbooks, you may be doing little more than saying
the words to yourself. This is phonemic encoding,
which is inferior to semantic encoding for retention of
verbal material. When you can’t remember the information that you’ve read, your forgetting may be due
to ineffective encoding.
DECAY
Instead of focusing on encoding, decay theory attributes forgetting to the impermanence of memory
storage. Decay theory proposes that forgetting occurs
because memory traces fade with time. The implicit
assumption is that decay occurs in the physiological
mechanisms responsible for memories. According
to decay theory, the mere passage of time produces
forgetting. This notion meshes nicely with common
sense views of forgetting.
As we saw earlier, decay does appear to contribute to the loss of information from the sensory and short-term memory stores. However, the
critical task for theories of forgetting is to explain
the loss of information from long-term memory.
Researchers have not been successful in providing
clear demonstrations that decay causes long-term
memory forgetting (Roediger et al., 2010). Not all
looking at this disparity between recall and recognition tests. One view is that recognition tests are especially sensitive measures of retention. The other view
is that recognition tests are excessively easy measures
of retention.
Actually, there is no guarantee that a recognition test will be easier than a recall test. This tends
to be the case, but the difficulty of a recognition
test can vary greatly, depending on the number,
similarity, and plausibility of the options provided
as possible answers. To illustrate, see whether you
know the answer to the following multiple-choice
question:
The capital of Nunavut is
a. Umingmaktok
b. Rankin Inlet
c. Igloolik
d. Iqaluit
Many students who aren’t from Nunavut find this a
fairly difficult question. The answer is Iqaluit. Now
take a look at the next question:
The capital of Nunavut is
a. London
b. New York City
c. Tokyo
d. Iqaluit
Virtually anyone can answer this question because
the incorrect options are readily dismissed. Although
this illustration is a bit extreme, it shows that two
recognition measures of the same information can be
dramatically different in difficulty.
The third method of measuring forgetting is
relearning. A relearning measure of retention
requires a participant to memorize information a
second time to determine how much time or how
many practice trials are saved by having learned
it before. To use this method, a researcher measures
how much time (or how many practice trials) a person
needs in order to memorize something. At a later date,
the participant is asked to relearn the information.
The researcher measures how much more quickly the
material is memorized the second time. Participants’
savings scores provide an estimate of their retention.
For example, if it takes you 20 minutes to memorize
a list the first time and only 5 minutes to memorize it a week later, you’ve saved 15 minutes. Your
savings score of 75 percent (i.e., 15/20 = 3/4 =
75 percent) suggests that you have retained 75 percent
and forgotten the remaining 25 percent of the information. Relearning measures can detect retention
that is overlooked by recognition tests (Crowder &
Greene, 2000).

Human Memory 271
There are two kinds of interference: retroactive
interference and proactive interference (Jacoby et
al., 2001). Retroactive interference occurs when
new information impairs the retention of previously learned information. Retroactive interference occurs between the original learning and
the retest on that learning, during the retention
interval (see Figure 7.14). For example, the interference manipulated by McGeoch and McDonald
(1931) was retroactive interference. In contrast,
proactive interference occurs when previously
learned information interferes with the retention of new information. Proactive interference is
rooted in learning that comes before exposure to
the test material.
RETRIEVAL FAILURE
People often remember things that they were unable
to recall at an earlier time. This phenomenon may
be obvious only during struggles with the tip-of-thetongue phenomenon, but it happens frequently. In
fact, a great deal of forgetting may be due to breakdowns in the process of retrieval.
Why does an effort to retrieve something fail
on one occasion and succeed on another? That’s a
tough question. As we suggested earlier in our discussion of context- and state-dependent encoding,
theorists have abandoned the concept of decay,
however. Based on complicated evidence relating
to the neurological and molecular bases of memory,
Hardt, Nader, and Nadel (2013) argue that decay
processes contribute to the selective removal of
some memories. They believe that decay weakens
the neurobiological substrate of selected memories, and that this process unfolds primarily during
sleep. It remains to be seen if this new theory will
gain traction.
For many decades, the key problem for decay
theory has been researchers’ inability to validate
its cornerstone prediction that the principal cause
and strongest correlate of forgetting should be the
passage of time. In studies of long-term memory,
researchers have repeatedly found that the passage of time is not nearly as influential as what
happens during the time interval. Research has
shown that forgetting depends not on the amount
of time that has passed since learning, but on the
amount, complexity, and type of information that
participants have had to absorb during that period
of time. The negative impact of competing information on retention is called interference, which we
turn to next.
INTERFERENCE
Interference theory proposes that people forget
information because of competition from other
material. Although demonstrations of decay in
long-term memory have remained elusive, hundreds
of studies have shown that interference influences
forgetting (Anderson & Neely, 1996; Bjork, 1992;
Bower, 2000; Jonker et al., 2015). In many of these
studies, researchers have controlled interference by
varying the similarity between the original material
given to participants (the test material) and the material studied in the intervening period. Interference
is assumed to be greatest when intervening material is most similar to the test material. Decreasing
the similarity should reduce interference and cause
less forgetting. This is exactly what McGeoch and
McDonald (1931) found in an influential study.
They had participants memorize test material that
consisted of a list of two-syllable adjectives. They
varied the similarity of intervening learning by
having participants then memorize one of five lists.
In order of decreasing similarity to the test material,
they were synonyms of the test words, antonyms of
the test words, unrelated adjectives, nonsense syllables, and numbers. Later, participants’ recall of the
test material was measured. Figure 7.13 shows that as
the similarity of the intervening material decreased,
the amount of forgetting also decreased—because of
reduced interference.

Effects of interference. According to interference theory, more interference from competing information should produce more forgetting. McGeoch and McDonald (1931) controlled the amount
of interference with a learning task by varying the similarity of an intervening task. The results were
consistent with interference theory. The amount of interference is greatest at the left of the graph, as
is the amount of forgetting. As interference decreases (moving to the right on the graph), retention
improves. (Data from McGeoch & McDonald, 1931)

272 CHAPTER 7
one theory is that retrieval failures may be more
likely when a mismatch occurs between retrieval
cues and the encoding of the information you’re
searching for. According to Tulving and Thomson
(1973), a good retrieval cue is consistent with the
original encoding of the information to be recalled.
For example, if the sound of a word—its phonemic quality—was emphasized during encoding,
an effective retrieval cue should emphasize the
sound of the word. If the meaning of the word was
emphasized during encoding, semantic cues should
be best.
A general statement of the principle at work
here was formulated by Tulving and Thomson. The
encoding specificity principle states that the value of
a retrieval cue depends on how well it corresponds
to the memory code (Tulving & Thomson, 1973).
This principle provides one explanation for the
inconsistent success of retrieval efforts.
MOTIVATED FORGETTING
Many years ago, Sigmund Freud (1901) came up with
an entirely different explanation for retrieval failures.
As we noted in Chapter 1, Freud asserted that people
often keep embarrassing, unpleasant, or painful
memories buried in their unconscious. For example, a
person who was deeply wounded by perceived slights
at a childhood birthday party might suppress all recollection of that party. In his therapeutic work with
patients, Freud recovered many such buried memories. He theorized that the memories were there all
along, but their retrieval was blocked by unconscious
avoidance tendencies.
The tendency to forget things one doesn’t want
to think about is called motivated forgetting, or to use
Freud’s terminology, repression. In Freudian theory,
repression refers to keeping distressing thoughts
and feelings buried in the unconscious (see Chapter
12). Although it is difficult to demonstrate the operation of repression in laboratory studies (Holmes,
1990), a number of experiments suggest that people
don’t remember anxiety-laden material as readily as
emotionally neutral material, just as Freud proposed
(Guenther, 1988; Reisner, 1998). Thus, when you
forget unpleasant things such as a dental appointment, a promise to help a friend move, or a term
paper deadline, motivated forgetting may be at work.

Retroactive and proactive interference. Retroactive interference occurs when learning produces
a “backward” effect, reducing recall of previously learned material. Proactive interference occurs when
learning produces a “forward” effect, reducing recall of subsequently learned material. For example,
if you were to prepare for an economics test and then study psychology, the interference from the
psychology study would be retroactive interference. However, if you studied psychology first and then
economics, the interference from the psychology study would be proactive interference. (Data from
Luh, 1922)
Misconception
The principal cause of forgetting is the gradual decay
of memory traces with time.
Reality
People subjectively feel like their memories gradually decay with the passage of time. But research has
shown that the simple passage of time is not nearly
as influential as other factors. Forgetting is mainly
attributable to interference, ineffective encoding,
reconstructive inaccuracy, and breakdowns in the
retrieval process.
REALITY CHECK
Figuring Out Forgetting
Check your understanding of why people forget by identifying the probable causes
of forgetting in each of the following scenarios. Choose from (a) motivated forgetting
(repression), (b) decay, (c) ineffective encoding, (d) proactive interference, (e) retroactive interference, or (f) retrieval failure. You will find the answers in Appendix A.

was daydreaming when it was discussed in her political science class.
2. Rufus hates his job at Taco Heaven and is always forgetting when he is

CONCEPT CHECK 7.2

Human Memory 273
L. M. Williams (1994) followed up on 129 female
children who had been brought to a hospital emergency room for treatment of sexual abuse. When
interviewed approximately 17 years later about a
variety of things, including their history of sexual
abuse, 38 percent of the women failed to report the
original incident, which Williams largely attributed
to amnesia for the incident. In a study of psychiatric
patients hospitalized for post-traumatic or dissociative disorders (see Chapter 15), one-third of those
who reported childhood sexual abuse said that they
experienced complete amnesia for the abuse at some
point in their lives (Chu et al., 1999). According to
Freyd (1996, 2001; Freyd et al., 2007), sexual abuse
by a parent evokes coping efforts that attempt to
block awareness of the abuse because that awareness would interfere with normal attachment processes. The clinicians who accept the authenticity of
recovered memories of abuse attribute the upsurge
in recovered memories to therapists’ and clients’
increased sensitivity to an issue that people used to
be reluctant to discuss.
SKEPTICISM REGARDING RECOVERED
MEMORIES
In contrast, beginning in the 1990s, many other
psychologists, especially memory researchers, have
expressed skepticism about the upsurge of recovered
The Repressed Memories Controversy
Although the concept of repression has been
around for over a century, interest in this phenomenon has surged in recent decades, thanks to
a spate of prominent reports involving the return
of individuals’ long-lost memories of sexual abuse
and other traumas during childhood. The media
have been flooded with reports of adults accusing
their parents, teachers, and neighbours of horrific child abuse decades earlier, based on previously repressed memories of these travesties. For
the most part, these parents, teachers, and neighbours have denied the allegations. Many of them
have seemed genuinely baffled by the accusations,
which have torn some previously happy families
apart (Gudjonsson, 2001; McHugh et al., 2004). In
an effort to make sense of the charges, some accused
parents have argued that their children’s recollections are false memories created inadvertently by
well-intentioned therapists through the power of
suggestion. This is a critical issue since we know
that false memories and confessions can have great
impact and can be very persuasive in legal contexts
(Gorman, 2013; Kassin, 2012).
The controversy surrounding recovered memories of abuse is complex and difficult to sort out
(Otgaar et al., 2019; Patihis et al., 2013). What do
psychologists and psychiatrists have to say about the
authenticity of repressed memories? They are sharply
divided on the issue—so divided, in fact, that some
have used the term “memory wars” to describe the
debates surrounding validity of repressed memories
(Crews, 1995).
SUPPORT FOR RECOVERED MEMORIES
Many psychologists and psychiatrists, especially
clinicians involved in the treatment of psychological disorders, largely accept recovered memories
of abuse at face value (Banyard & Williams, 1999;
Briere & Conte, 1993; Legault & Laurence, 2007;
Skinner, 2001; Terr, 1994; Whitfield, 1995). They
assert that sexual abuse in childhood is far more
widespread than most people realize. For example,
one large-scale Canadian survey (MacMillan et al.,
1997), using a random sample of 9953 residents
of Ontario, found that 12.8 percent of the females
and 4.3 percent of the males reported that they had
been victims of sexual abuse during childhood (see
Figure 7.15).
Some psychologists and psychiatrists further assert that there is ample evidence that it is
common for people to bury traumatic incidents
in their unconscious (Brewin, 2012; DePrince et
al., 2012). For instance, in one widely cited study,

Estimates of the prevalence of childhood physical and

about whether they were abused during childhood. As you can
see, males were more likely to have experienced physical abuse,
and females were more likely to have suffered from sexual abuse.
The data support the assertion that millions of people have been
victimized by childhood sexual abuse, which is far from rare. (Based
on data from MacMillan et al., 1997)

et al., 2004; Loftus & Cahill, 2007; Strange et al.,
2007). For example, building on much earlier work
by James Deese (1959), Henry Roediger and Kathleen
McDermott (1995, 2000) devised a simple laboratory
paradigm that is remarkably reliable in producing
memory illusions. In this procedure, now known
as the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, a
series of lists of 15 words is presented to participants,
who are asked to recall the words immediately after
each list is presented and are given a recognition
measure of their retention at the end of the session.
The trick is that each list consists of a set of words
(such as bed, rest, awake, tired) that are strongly associated with another target word that is not on the
list (in this case, sleep). When participants recall the
words on each list, they remember the nonpresented
target word more than 50 percent of the time, and
when they are given the final recognition test, they
typically indicate that about 80 percent of the nonstudied target words were presented in the lists (see
Figure 7.16).
The memory illusions created in this experiment may seem trivial in comparison with the vivid,
detailed recollections of previously forgotten sexual
abuse that have generated the repressed memories
controversy. But these false memories can be reliably
created in normal participants in a matter of minutes, with little effort and no pressure or misleading
memories of abuse (Kihlstrom, 2004; Loftus, 1998,
2003; Lynn & Nash, 1994; McNally, 2003, 2007;
Takarangi et al., 2008). They point out that the
women in the Williams (1994) study may have failed
to report their earlier sexual abuse for a variety of
reasons besides amnesia, including embarrassment,
poor rapport with the interviewer, normal forgetfulness, or a conscious preference not to revisit painful
experiences from the past (Loftus et al., 1998; Pope
& Hudson, 1998). Many memory researchers are
also skeptical about retrospective self-reports of
amnesia—such as those seen in the Chu et al. (1999)
study—because self-assessments of personal memory
are often distorted and because it is difficult to distinguish between a period when a memory was
not accessed versus a period when a memory was
not available due to repression (Belli et al., 1998;
Schooler, 1999).
The skeptics do not say that people are lying about
their previously repressed memories. Rather, they
maintain that some suggestible people wrestling with
emotional problems have been convinced by persuasive therapists that their emotional problems must be
the result of abuse that occurred years before. Critics
blame a minority of therapists who presumably have
good intentions but who operate under the dubious
assumption that virtually all psychological problems
are attributable to childhood sexual abuse (Lindsay
& Read, 1994; Spanos, 1994). Using hypnosis, dream
interpretation, and leading questions, they supposedly prod and probe patients until they inadvertently
create the memories of abuse that they are searching
for (Lynn et al., 2003; Thayer & Lynn, 2006).
Psychologists who doubt the authenticity of
repressed memories support their analysis by pointing
to discredited cases of recovered memories (Brown,
Goldstein, & Bjorklund, 2000). For example, with the
help of a church counsellor, one woman recovered
memories of how her minister father had repeatedly
raped her, gotten her pregnant, and then aborted the
pregnancy with a coat hanger; however, subsequent
evidence revealed that the woman was still a virgin
and that her father had had a vasectomy years before
(Loftus, 1997; Testa, 1996). The skeptics also point
to published case histories that clearly involved suggestive questioning and to cases in which patients
have recanted recovered memories of sexual abuse
after realizing that these memories were implanted
by their therapists (Goldstein & Farmer, 1993; Loftus,
1994; Shobe & Schooler, 2001).
Those who question the accuracy of repressed
memories also point to findings on the misinformation effect, research on source-monitoring errors, and
other demonstrations of the relative ease of creating
“memories” for events that never happened (Lindsay

memories of abuse fall in each category (McNally,
2017). That said, some evidence suggests that memories of abuse recovered through therapy are more
likely to be false memories than are those recovered
spontaneously (McNally & Geraerts, 2009). People
who report recovered memories of abuse seem to fall
into two very different groups. Some gradually recover
memories of abuse with the assistance of suggestive
therapeutic techniques, whereas others suddenly and
unexpectedly recover memories of abuse when they
encounter a relevant retrieval cue (such as returning
to the scene of the abuse). A study that sought to corroborate reports of abuse from both groups found a
much higher corroboration rate among those who
recovered their memories spontaneously (37 percent)
as opposed to those who recovered their memories in
therapy (0 percent) (Geraerts, 2012).
The recovered memories controversy continues
to generate heated debate (Patihis et al., 2014). One
upside is that the debate has inspired a tremendous amount of research that has greatly increased
our understanding of just how fragile, fallible, malleable, and subjective human memory can be (Gallo
& Lampinen, 2016). Indeed, the implicit dichotomy
underlying the repressed memories debate—that
some memories are true, whereas others are false—
is misleading and oversimplified. Research demonstrates that all human memories are imperfect
reconstructions of the past that are subject to many
types of distortion.
Seven Sins of Memory: How Memory
Goes Wrong
Our discussion of memory thus far has highlighted
several important points. Memory is key to understanding who we are and what we do. For most of
us in our everyday lives our memory serves us just
fine. It enables us to get through the day without
major mishap, to be where we are supposed to be at
the right time, to get the things done we need to get
done, to know the names of the people who are most
important to us, and to remember when the next
psychology test will be held. In fact, memory is typically so effective that we rarely think about it. When
we do reflect on it, it is often because it has failed
us—it has let us down. Memory doesn’t fail us only
because we simply forget; sometimes our memories
for events are distorted and biased.
Daniel Schacter (2001) of Harvard University, who
has received an American Psychological Association
Award for his Distinguished Scientific Contributions
(American Psychological Association, 2012), has collated and summarized the ways that memory fails
us in what he refers to as the seven sins of memory.
These seven sins are important not only because they
information. Moreover, memory researchers have
conducted more realistic studies of how false memories may be created in the real world.
For example, working with college students, Ira
Hyman and his colleagues managed to implant recollections of fairly substantial events—such as spilling
a punch bowl at a wedding, being in a grocery store
when the fire sprinkler system went off, being hospitalized for an earache—in about 25 percent of their
participants, just by asking them to elaborate on
events supposedly reported by their parents (Hyman
& Kleinknecht, 1999). Other studies succeeded in
implanting false memories of nearly drowning (Heaps
& Nash, 2001), of being attacked by a vicious animal
(Porter et al., 1999), and of becoming ill after eating
a certain food (Bernstein & Loftus, 2009). In one
study, Shaw and Porter (2015) mimicked the suggestive tactics sometimes employed by law enforcement
that have been shown to occasionally produce genuinely believed false confessions of crimes (Kassin et
al., 2012). They wanted to see if they could convince
college students that they had repressed a memory
of a crime (theft, assault, or assault with a weapon)
resulting in police contact that they had supposedly
committed between the ages of 11 and 14. By the
end of their third weekly interview, 70 percent of
the participants exhibited fairly detailed false memories of committing a crime that they had not really
committed.
Some critics argue that memory implantation
studies overestimate the ease with which false memories can be created (Becker-Blease & Freyd, 2017).
For example, Brewin and Andrews (2016) argue that
only about 15 percent of participants in these studies
exhibit full autobiographical memories as opposed
to false beliefs. However, a re-analysis of eight key
memory implantation studies concluded that 30
percent of participants displayed false memories,
and another 23 percent displayed partial acceptance (Scoboria et al., 2017). Furthermore, Nash et
al. (2017) point out that even if only 15 percent
of people were susceptible to false memories, that
would present a serious problem for courts dealing
with cases of recovered memories of abuse.
CONCLUSIONS
So, what can we conclude about the recovered memories controversy? It seems pretty clear that therapists can unknowingly create false memories in their
patients and that a significant portion of recovered
memories of abuse are the product of suggestion
(Follette & Davis, 2009; Loftus & Davis, 2006). But it
also seems likely that some cases of recovered memories are authentic (Colangelo, 2009; Ost, 2013). It is
difficult to estimate what proportion of recovered

of the past. According to Schacter, we often edit or
rewrite our previous experiences: “The result can be
a skewed rendering of a specific incident, or even
of an extended period in our lives, which says more
about how we feel now than about what happened
then” (Schacter, 2001, p. 5). For example, if currently
you are having trouble with your romantic partner,
your memory for past events in the relationship may
be disproportionately negative (Murray, 2003). The
final sin, persistence, involves unwanted memories or
recollections that you cannot forget—memories that
haunt you. While we all have experience with seemingly automatic, unwanted memories and thoughts,
in the extreme they can be associated with depression
and post-traumatic stress disorder (see Chapter 15).
While these memory sins or failures are clearly
problematic and cause discomfort and embarrassment to us, does this mean that it is accurate to call
our memory system a failed system? Not at all. As
we suggested at the beginning of this section, most
of the time, it serves us extremely well. Even though
Schacter is well known for his analysis of memory
sins, he comes to the same conclusion: “I suggest
that the seven sins are by-products of otherwise adaptive features of memory, a price we pay for processes
and functions that serve us well in many respects”
(Schacter, 2001, p. 184). Each of the seven sins has
an adaptive upside. For example, the forgetting that
occurs over time (transience) allows us to reduce the
accessibility of or to discard information that is no
longer relevant, such as the date of your first test in
psychology (so that you can concentrate on your
next test!). The reality of the seven sins of memory
doesn’t mean that there aren’t ways to improve it.

affect us in our daily life, but also because knowing
more about them gives us insight into how memory
works and perhaps give us some insight into ways to
help those with disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease
(Schacter & Dodson, 2001).
The first three memory sins, transience, absentmindedness, and blocking, according to Schacter,
are sins of omission in which we cannot bring the
memory to mind. Transience is the simple weakening
of a memory over time. This is what we tend to
think of most often when we think about memory
failure. Absentmindedness refers to a memory failure
that is often due to a failure to pay attention because
we are perhaps preoccupied with other things.
Examples might be losing your keys, misplacing your
flash drive, or—like cellist Yo Yo Ma—leaving your
$2.5 million cello in the trunk of a New York City
taxi (it was later returned to him) (Murray, 2003).
Blocking is an often temporary problem that occurs
when we fail to retrieve an item of information such
as someone’s name when we meet them. Of course,
this is similar to what we have referred to as the tipof-the-tongue phenomenon.
The next four sins, misattribution, suggestibility,
bias, and persistence, are sins of commission. Sins of
commission are memory problems where some type
of memory is present, but the memory is either “incorrect or unwanted” (Schacter, 2001, p. 5). In misattribution, we assign a memory to the wrong source, as
in the earlier example about whether the psychology
professor or the sociology professor delayed the exam
(recall our discussion of source monitoring earlier in
the chapter). In the sin of suggestibility our memory
is distorted because of, for example, misleading questions (recall the discussion of the misinformation
effect). The sin of bias refers to inaccuracy due to the
effect of our current knowledge on our reconstruction

In Search of the Memory Trace: The Physiology of Memory
For decades, neuroscientists have ventured forth in
search of the physiological basis for memory (e.g,
McConnell, 1962; Rilling, 1996; Rissman & Wagner,
2012), often referred to as the “memory trace.” On
several occasions scientists have been excited by new
leads, only to be led down blind alleys (e.g., Penfield
& Perot, 1963).
Despite these early disappointments, investigators continue to explore a variety of encouraging
leads about the physiological and neural bases
for memory, using a variety of classic and more
recent techniques (Kandel et al., 2014; Rissman &
Wagner, 2012). In light of past failures, these lines
of research should probably be viewed with guarded
optimism. But we’ll look at some of the more promising approaches.
The Neural Circuitry of Memory
One line of research suggests that memory formation
results in alterations in synaptic transmission at specific sites. According to this view, specific memories
depend on biochemical changes that occur at specific
synapses. Eric Kandel (2001) and his colleagues have
studied conditioned reflexes in a simple organism—
the aplysia, a sea slug, commonly referred to as the
sea hare. In research that earned a Nobel Prize for
Kandel, they showed that reflex learning in the sea
slug produces changes in the strength of specific

that were seen when they first learned the word
pairings (Jang et al., 2017). Other research has also
suggested that the retrieval of memories involves
the reinstatement of patterns of neural activity that
occurred during the original experiences (Davachi &
Preston, 2014).
Evidence on long-term potentiation also supports
the idea that memory traces consist of specific
neural circuits. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a
long-lasting increase in neural excitability at synapses along a specific neural pathway. Researchers
produce LTP artificially by sending a burst of highfrequency electrical stimulation along a neural
pathway, but theorists suspect that natural events
produce the same sort of potentiated neural circuit
when a memory is formed (Abraham, 2006; Lynch,
2004; Sweatt, 2009). LTP appears to involve changes
in both presynaptic (sending) and postsynaptic
(receiving) neurons in neural circuits in the hippocampus (Bi & Poo, 2001). The evidence on LTP
has inspired promising work on the development
of drugs that might enhance memory in humans
(Lynch & Gall, 2006). Of course, research in this area
confirms the ideas proposed by McGill psychologist
Donald Hebb (1949; reviewed in Chapters 1 and 3),
who developed the Hebbian learning rule laying out
the effects of neurons repeatedly stimulating other
neurons (Sejnowski & Tesauro, 1989).
Research suggests that the process of neurogenesis—the formation of new neurons—may contribute to the sculpting of neural circuits that
underlie memory (Déry et al., 2015). As we noted in
Chapter 3, scientists discovered relatively recently
that new brain cells are formed constantly in the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Drew et al., 2013).
Animal studies show that manipulations that suppress neurogenesis lead to memory impairments on
many types of learning tasks, and that conditions
that increase neurogenesis tend to be associated
with enhanced learning (Leuner et al., 2006). The
synaptic connections by enhancing the availability
and release of neurotransmitters at these synapses
(Bailey & Kandel, 2009; Kennedy et al., 1992).
The aplysia is an ideal animal to examine if you
are interested in the neuronal basis of behaviour.
It has only 20 000 neurons as compared to our
100 billion, and its neurons are large enough to see
and identify with only the naked eye (Kandel, 2008).
The aplysia is distinguished by a reflex it uses to protect its external gill by withdrawing it. This reflex
action is referred to as the GSWR (gill and siphon
withdrawal reflex). The slug typically draws water
over its gill by using its siphon. The gill is withdrawn
if there is a threat or noxious stimulus. By applying a
noxious stimulus to the slug’s tail—a mild electrical
shock—Kandel and his colleagues were able to elicit
the reflex.
Once the animal is “sensitized,” according to
Kandel (2008), it has exhibited implicit memory, it has
learned it is afraid—it has learned fear. (We discuss
implicit and explicit memory later in the chapter.)
Kandel found that if the shock producing the reflex
was then applied to the siphon, the slug withdrew
its gills more quickly than before and exhibited
the reflex more quickly than unsensitized animals.
Repetition was found to produce long-term memory
in the aplysia. A durable memory had been produced
through changes in synaptic connections (Hawkins
et al., 1989). Kandel then went on to uncover the
neurochemistry of the implicit memory or learning.
Kandel believes that durable changes in synaptic
transmission may be the neural building blocks of
more complex memories as well (Kandel, 2006,
2008). He was convinced that the biology of the
mind was one of the most critical topics in science
(Kandel, 2000a, 2000b). Kandel details his thinking
and research in his very readable autobiography In
Search of Memory: The Emergence of a New Science of
Mind (Kandel, 2006).
Richard F. Thompson (1992, 2005, 2013) and
his colleagues have shown that specific memories
may depend on localized neural circuits in the brain.
In other words, memories may create unique, reusable pathways in the brain along which signals flow.
Thompson has traced the pathway that accounts for a
rabbit’s memory of a conditioned eye blink response.
The key link in this circuit is a microscopic spot in
the cerebellum, a structure in the hindbrain (see
Figure 7.17). Thompson theorizes that other memories probably create entirely different pathways in
other areas of the brain. Consistent with this line of
thinking, a recent study that monitored the activity
of individual neurons in an area of the cortex found
that when people retrieved word pairs from memory,
they reinstated the unique patterns of neural activity

referred to as H.M., has been followed by McGill’s
Brenda Milner and her colleagues since 1953 (Casey,
2016; Corkin, 1984; Milner et al., 1968; Scoville &
Milner, 1957).
H.M. had a relatively normal childhood until, on
his 16th birthday, he suffered his first of many grand
mal seizures (Schaffhausen, 2007). By 1953, he was
having as many as 11 epileptic seizures a week and
he needed some type of intervention. He had surgery to relieve debilitating epileptic seizures in 1953.
Unfortunately, the surgery inadvertently wiped
out most of his ability to form long-term memories. H.M.’s short-term memory remained fine, but
he had no recollection of anything that happened
after 1953 (other than about the most recent 20–30
seconds of his life). He didn’t recognize the doctors
treating him, and he couldn’t remember routes to
and from places. He could read a magazine story over
and over, thinking he was reading it for the first time
each time. He couldn’t remember what he did the
previous day, let alone what he had done decades
earlier. He couldn’t even recognize current photos of
himself, despite having looked in the mirror every
day, as aging had changed his appearance considerably. Although he could not form new long-term
memories, H.M.’s intelligence remained intact. He
could care for himself (around his own home), carry
on complicated conversations, and solve crossword
puzzles. H.M.’s misfortune provided a golden opportunity for memory researchers.
In the decades after his surgery, over 100
researchers have studied various aspects of his
memory performance, leading to several major discoveries about the nature of memory (Maugh, 2008).
As one scientist put it in commenting on H.M.,
“More was learned about memory by research with
just one patient than was learned in the previous
100 years of research on memory” (Miller, 2009).
After his death, H.M.’s brain was donated to a lab
at the University of California, San Diego. It was
subjected to extensive brain imaging and then one
year after his death his brain was cut into thousands
of thin slices for further study by scientists all over
the world (Becker, 2009; Carey, 2009). The painstaking, methodical 53-hour dissection was broadcast
live over the Internet and watched by over 400 000
people. The meticulous dissection eventually led to
the creation of a three-dimensional model of H.M.’s
brain that should foster additional research (Annese
et al., 2014). Named H. M. in order to protect his
privacy while he was alive, his real name was Henry
Molaison, and he was perhaps the most examined
and important patient ever in neuroscience (LaFee,
2009).
hippocampus produces thousands of new cells each
day, but a significant portion of them die within a
few weeks. However, learning experiences that are
new, effortful, and successful greatly increase the
survival of these new cells, providing further evidence that neurogenesis supports learning (Shors,
2014; DiFeo & Shors, 2017). Theorists also note that
neurogenesis provides the brain with a supply of
neurons that vary in age, and these variations may
somehow allow the brain to “timestamp” memories, which may contribute to the hippocampal
function of indexing distinct memories (Stuchlik,
2014). That said, the theorizing about how neurogenesis contributes to memory is speculative. In
fact, some theorists believe that neurogenesis may
also play a role in forgetting (Frankland & Josselyn,
2016). According to this line of thinking, neurogenesis leads to a continuous remodeling of hippocampal circuits that incrementally clears memories
from the hippocampus.
The Anatomy of Memory
Cases of organic amnesia—extensive memory loss due
to head injury—are another source of clues about the
physiological bases of memory (Mayes, 1992). There
are two basic types of amnesia: retrograde and anterograde (see Figure 7.18). Retrograde amnesia involves
the loss of memories for events that occurred prior
to the onset of amnesia. For example, a 25-year-old
gymnast who sustains a head trauma might find the
prior three years, or seven years, or her entire lifetime erased. Anterograde amnesia involves the loss
of memories for events that occur after the onset of
amnesia. For instance, after her accident, the injured
gymnast might suffer impaired ability to remember
people she meets, where she has parked her car, and
so on.
The study of anterograde amnesia has proven to
be an especially rich source of information about
the brain and memory. One well-known case that
we referred to in Chapters 1 and 3, that of a man

al., 2016; Stamm et al., 2014). In any event, memories are consolidated in the hippocampal region and
then stored in diverse and widely distributed areas
of the cortex (Shrager & Squire, 2009). Although
memories are stored across far-flung areas in the
cortex, the hippocampus continues to play a crucial integrative role, as it compiles an “index” of
where specific memories are located (Moscovitch et
al., 2016). Hence, an effort to retrieve a particular
memory leads to hippocampal activity that reactivates a link to a specific cortical area, which reinstates the memory. Consistent with this analysis,
brain imaging studies show that broad networks
of the brain are activated during memory retrieval
(Geib et al., 2017). Although the hippocampus
seems to orchestrate the process, memory retrieval
appears to depend on activity in many brain circuits
and regions, leading to the conclusion that “our
ability to remember the past is a whole-brain experience” (Shimamura, 2014, p. 261).
Even after consolidation, however, memories
may be subject to modification, primarily when
they are reactivated. Studies suggest that when consolidated memories are retrieved, the reactivated
memories are temporarily returned to an unstable
state, from which they must be restabilized through
a process called reconsolidation (Hardt et al., 2010).
During reconsolidation, depending on what happens, the memories may be weakened, strengthened, or updated to take into account more recent
information (Schwabe et al., 2014). This dynamic
flexibility is thought to make long-term memory
more adaptive than it would be if memories were
H.M.’s memory losses were originally attributed
to the removal of his hippocampus (see Figure 7.17),
although theorists now understand that other
nearby structures that were removed also contributed to H.M.’s dramatic memory deficits (Delis
& Lucas, 1996). H.M.’s autopsy in 2008 precisely
delineated the areas that were damaged, which
included most of the hippocampus, as well as the
entorhinal and perirhinal cortex and parts of other
structures (Augustinack et al., 2014). Scientists now
believe that the entire hippocampal region and adjacent areas in the cortex play a role in long-term
memory (Eichenbaum, 2013b; Leutgeb & Leutgeb,
2014). This broader memory complex is sometimes
referred to as the medial temporal lobe memory system
(Davachi & Preston, 2014). Given its apparent role in
long-term memory, it’s interesting to note that the
hippocampal region is one of the first areas of the
brain to sustain significant damage in the course of
Alzheimer’s disease, which produces severe memory
impairment in many people, typically after age 65
(Shrager & Squire, 2009; see Chapter 11).
Do these findings mean that memories are
stored in the hippocampal region and adjacent
areas? Probably not. Most theorists believe that the
medial temporal lobe memory system plays a key
role in the consolidation of memories (Dudai, 2004).
Consolidation is a hypothetical process involving
the gradual conversion of new, unstable memories into stable, durable memory codes stored in
long-term memory. Interestingly, research suggests
that much of the consolidation process may unfold
while people sleep (Goerke et al., 2017; Maingret et

etched in concrete, but it is important to note that
the updating process can introduce distortions (St.
Jacques & Schacter, 2013). Hence, even the neural
architecture of long-term memory seems to be inherently reconstructive. Reactivation can occur even
during sleep. The effects of targeted memory reactivation (TMR) are explored in our next Featured
Study.
As you can see, a variety of biochemical processes,
neural circuits, and anatomical structures have been
implicated as playing a role in memory. Looking for
the physiological basis for memory is only slightly
less daunting than looking for the physiological basis
for thought itself.

FEATURED STUDY
Some theorists believe that evidence on the physiology of memory is confusing because investigators
are unwittingly probing into several distinct memory
systems that have different physiological bases. A
number of research findings inspired this view, foremost among them being the discovery of implicit
memory. Let’s look at this perplexing phenomenon.
Implicit versus Explicit Memory
As noted earlier, patients with anterograde amnesia
often appear to have no ability to form long-term
memories. If they’re shown a list of words and subsequently given a test of retention, their performance
is miserable. However, different findings emerge
when “implicit” techniques are used to measure
their memory indirectly. For instance, they might
be asked to work on a word recognition or completion task that is not presented as a measure of retention. In this task, they are shown fragments of words
(e.g., _ss_ss__ for assassin) and are asked to complete the
fragments with the first appropriate word that comes
to mind. The series of word fragments includes ones
that correspond to words on a list they saw earlier. In
this situation, the amnesiac participants respond with
words that were on the list just as frequently as normal
participants who also saw the initial list (Schacter et
al., 1993). Thus, the amnesiacs do remember words
from the list. However, when asked, they don’t even
remember having been shown the list.
One of the issues that has been raised in this literature concerns the durability of our implicit memories. In fact, research has suggested that they are
quite durable (Maylor, 1998) in their effects, often
lasting much longer than our explicit memories for
such events (Mitchell & Brown, 1988; Sloman et al.,
1988). Thus, our implicit memory for events can continue to affect our behaviour long after our explicit/
conscious memory for the events that created them
has deteriorated (Tulving et al., 1982). But, how long
is long in this context? Could our implicit memories continue to have effects even decades later? This
question was examined in our Featured Study by
David Mitchell.

FEATURED STUDY
The demonstration of long-term retention in
amnesiacs who previously appeared to have no longterm memory shocked memory experts when it was
first reported by Warrington and Weiskrantz (1970).
However, this surprising finding has been replicated
in many subsequent studies. This phenomenon
has come to be known as implicit memory. Implicit
memory is apparent when retention is exhibited
on a task that does not require intentional remembering. Implicit memory is contrasted with explicit
memory, which involves intentional recollection of
previous experiences. According to Kandel (2008),
three characteristics serve to distinguish implicit
and explicit memory. First, they differ in the types

memory, and retrospective and prospective memory.

Gallie, 1992; Jacoby, 1988; Roediger, 1990). However,
many other theorists argue that the differences exist
because implicit and explicit memory are handled
by independent memory systems (Schacter, 1992,
1994; Squire, 1994). These independent systems are
referred to as declarative and procedural memory.
Declarative versus Nondeclarative
Memory
Many theorists have suggested that people have
separate memory systems for different kinds of information (see Figure 7.19). The most basic division
of memory into distinct systems contrasts declarative memory with nondeclarative or procedural memory
(Squire 2004, 2009; Winograd, 1975). The declarative memory system handles factual information. It
contains recollections of words, definitions, names,
dates, faces, events, concepts, and ideas. The nondeclarative or procedural memory system houses
memory for actions, skills, operations, and conditioned responses. It contains procedural memories of
how to execute such actions as riding a bike, typing,
and tying one’s shoes.
Support for the distinction between declarative
and nondeclarative memory comes from evidence
that the two systems seem to operate somewhat
of knowledge stored—mostly perceptual and motor
skills in implicit memory and facts and events in
explicit memory. Implicit memories though are not
restricted to perceptual or procedural memories.
Second, the primary sites in the brain where storage
takes place differ—reflex pathways; the cerebellum
for implicit memory and the hippocampus and
temporal lobe for explicit memory. Third, there are
differences in the recall strategies used in accessing
or using the information; they are conscious and
deliberate for explicit memory but unconscious
or unintentional for implicit memories. While we
may intentionally try to remember the name of our
psychology professor (explicit memory), our use
of implicit memories is not the result of conscious
retrieval. Thus, we may not be able to remember
the name when asked by a friend. But our implicit
memory can still affect us. But how can we assess
whether such implicit memories actually exist? The
effects of implicit memories are commonly inferred
from their effects on tasks such as the word completion task referred to earlier (e.g., _ss_ss__ for assassin).
Is implicit memory peculiar to people suffering
from amnesia? No. When normal participants are
exposed to material and their retention of it is measured indirectly, they, too, show implicit memory
(Schacter, 1987, 1989). To draw a parallel with
everyday life, implicit memory is simply incidental,
unintentional remembering (Mandler, 1989). People
frequently remember things that they didn’t deliberately store in memory. For example, you might
recall the colour of a jacket that your professor wore
yesterday. Likewise, people remember things without
deliberate retrieval efforts. For instance, you might be
telling someone about a restaurant, which somehow
reminds you of an unrelated story about a mutual
friend.
Research has uncovered many interesting differences between implicit and explicit memory
(May et al., 2005; Reder et al., 2009; Roediger,
1990; Smith et al., 2014; Tulving & Schacter, 1990).
Explicit memory is conscious, is accessed directly,
and can best be assessed with recall or recognition
measures of retention. Implicit memory is unconscious, must be accessed indirectly, and can best be
assessed with variations on relearning (savings) measures of retention. Implicit memory is largely unaffected by amnesia, age, the administration of certain
drugs (such as alcohol), the length of the retention
interval, and manipulations of interference. In contrast, explicit memory is affected very much by all of
these factors.
Some theorists think these differences are found
because implicit and explicit memory rely on different
cognitive processes in encoding and retrieval (Graf &

Theories of independent memory systems. There is some evidence that different types of
information are stored in separate memory systems, which may have distinct physiological bases.
The diagram shown here, which blends the ideas of several theorists, is an adaptation of Larry Squire’s
(1987) scheme. Note that implicit and explicit memory are not memory systems. They are observed
behavioural phenomena that appear to be handled by different hypothetical memory systems (the
procedural and declarative memory systems), which cannot be observed directly.

282 CHAPTER 7
decades of research have led to progress toward identifying the neural bases for declarative versus nondeclarative memory (Eichenbaum, 2013).
Semantic versus Episodic Memory
As we discussed at the beginning of the chapter, Endel
Tulving (1986, 2002; Tulving & Szpunar, 2009) has
further subdivided declarative memory into episodic
and semantic memory (see Figure 7.19). Both contain
factual information, but episodic memory contains
personal facts and semantic memory contains general
facts (Mayes & Roberts, 2001; Tulving, 2001; Renoult
et al., 2019). The episodic memory system is made up
of chronological, or temporally dated, recollections
of personal experiences. Episodic memory is a record
of things you’ve done, seen, and heard—it serves to
associate the stimuli you have experienced with the
personal context in which you were exposed to them
(Hill et al., 2020; Massol et al., 2020; Ngo et al., 2019;
Yim et al., 2013). It includes information about when
you did these things, saw them, or heard them. It
contains recollections about being in a school play,
visiting the Parliament buildings in Ottawa, seeing
the Pixies in concert, or going to see the long-awaited
final episode of the Harry Potter film series as part of a
field trip with your school classmates. Paradoxically,
our episodic memories of our past provide the foundation for our thinking about the future. People frequently attempt to imagine future events so as to
better prepare for them (D’Argembeau et al., 2011).
These episodic simulations, which are guided by our
episodic memories, can even have consequences for
our psychological well-being (Jing et al., 2016).
While most of us frequently have trouble remembering specific events in our past and wish we had a
better memory, what do you think it would be like
to be able to remember almost everything that has
ever happened to you and to have these memories
unintentionally intrude on what you are trying to
do now? This is the case for a woman named “AJ”
who was born in 1965. Her episodic memory is so
powerful that it “dominates” her waking life (Parker
et al., 2006). According to her own account, it’s a
burden:
My memory has ruled my life.... There is no
effort to it.... I want to know why I remember
everything.... It’s like a running movie that never
stops.... I’ll be talking to someone and seeing
something else.... Like we’re sitting here talking
and I’m talking to you and in my head I’m
thinking about something that happened to me in
December 1982, it was a Friday, I started to work
at G’s (a store).... When I hear a date, I see it, the
differently (Johnson,
2013; Squire et al., 1993).
For example, the recall of
factual information generally depends on conscious, effortful processes,
whereas memory for conditioned reflexes is largely
automatic, and memories
for skills often require
little effort and attention (Johnson, 2003).
People execute perceptual-motor tasks—such
as playing the piano or
typing—with little conscious awareness of what
they’re doing. In fact, performance on such tasks
sometimes deteriorates if
people think too much
about what they’re doing.
Another disparity is that
the memory for skills—
such as typing and bike
riding—doesn’t decline
much over long retention
intervals, whereas declarative memory is more
vulnerable to forgetting.
The notion that declarative and procedural
memories are separate is
supported by certain patterns of memory loss seen
in amnesiacs. In many
cases, declarative memory
is severely impaired,
whereas procedural
memory is left largely
intact (Mulligan & Besken,
2013). For example, H.M.,
the victim of amnesia discussed earlier, was able to
learn and remember new
motor skills, even though
he couldn’t remember
what he looked like as
he aged. The sparing of
procedural memory in
H.M. provided crucial evidence for the distinction
between declarative and nondeclarative memory. The
finding also suggested that different brain structures
may be involved in the two types of memory. Indeed,
Research suggests that memory for perceptual-motor skills,
such as the skilled manoeuvres that made the late NBA star
Kobe Bryant one of the most dominant players of his era, is
stored in the procedural (nondeclarative) memory system.
In contrast, memory for factual information, such as the constraints of the three-second violation, is thought to be stored
in the declarative memory system.

any personally experienced events (Rosenbaum et al.,
2005). However, debate continues about the neural
substrates of episodic and semantic memory (Barba
et al., 1998; Wiggs et al., 1999).
Some of our specific memories represent a combination of episodic and semantic memories (Conway
& Williams, 2008), and these autobiographical memories have been the subject of a great deal of research
activity (Holland & Kensinger, 2010; Koppel &
Rubin, 2016; Willoughby et al., 2012). According
to Conway and Williams (2008), autobiographical
memories are constructive in nature, and represent
an act of remembering where episodic and semantic
long-term memories are “brought together in an act
of remembering where they form a specific memory”
(p. 893) about your life. They enable us to know who
we are now, who we were in the past, and who we
might yet become.
Prospective versus Retrospective
Memory
A 1984 paper with a clever title, “Remembering to Do
Things: A Forgotten Topic” (Harris, 1984), introduced
yet another distinction between types of memory:
prospective memory versus retrospective memory (see
Figure 7.20). Prospective memory involves remembering to perform actions in the future. Examples
of prospective memory tasks include remembering
to walk the dog, to call someone, to grab the tickets
for the big game, and to turn off your lawn sprinkler.
In contrast, retrospective memory involves remembering events from the past or previously learned
information. Retrospective memory is at work when
you try to recall who won the Stanley Cup last year,
when you reminisce about your high school days,
or when you try to recall what your professor said
in a lecture last week. A key difference between retrospective and prospective memory is that in the
day, the month, the year.... I see it as I saw it that
day.... it’s a burden. (Parker et al., 2006, p. 35)
AJ seems to be able to accurately remember almost
everything that happened to her, especially since she
was 14 years old. What a great thing to have this
memory of her experiences, right? This superior
autobiographical memory did not help her in school;
she was a mediocre student. It also did not help her
in her career; she has spent the past few years in a
series of temporary jobs. She has suffered from several psychological disorders because of her unrelenting memory. Her autobiographical memory was
so unique that the psychologists who did research on
her memory gave it a new term: hyperthymestic syndrome (Parker et al., 2006). While she was known as
“AJ” in the scientific community for years, because of
the publication of her autobiography (Price, 2008),
we now know that her real name is Jill Price.
While AJ’s experiences are very unusual, for
most of us our episodic memory is critical. Episodic
memory is important to us in terms of keeping a
record of our personal experiences. It is important
to us in other ways too. For example, it affords us
the opportunity for time travel (Tulving, 2002). In
travelling through time, we use our episodic memories to simulate what might happen in the future, we
“project ourselves into the future based on what we
remember from the past” (Schacter & Addis, 2007c,
p. 27). One of the deficits that accompanies memory
loss when we age is the fact that we tend to remember
the past and imagine what might happen to us in the
future in “less episodic detail” (Schacter et al., 2013).
The semantic memory system contains general
knowledge that is not tied to the time when the
information was learned. Semantic memory contains information such as Christmas is December
25, dogs have four legs, and Saskatoon is located
in Saskatchewan. You probably don’t remember
when you learned these facts (McNamara, 2013).
Information like this is usually stored undated. The
distinction between episodic and semantic memory
can be better appreciated by drawing an analogy to
books: Episodic memory is like an autobiography,
whereas semantic memory is like an encyclopedia.
Some studies suggest that episodic and semantic
memory may have distinct neural bases (Moscovitch
et al., 2016; Schacter et al., 2000; Tulving, 2002). For
instance, some amnesiacs forget mostly personal
facts, while their recall of general facts is largely unaffected (Szpunar & McDermott, 2009). Also consistent
with this distinction is the case of patient K.C., to
whom we referred earlier. K.C. retained much of his
general knowledge of the world after suffering head
trauma in an accident but was unable to remember
Jill Price suffered from a
memory disorder referred
to as hyperthymestic
syndrome, which caused
her to be haunted by her
episodic memories.

and other work areas where safety is of paramount
importance (Grundgeiger et al., 2014).
People vary considerably in their ability to successfully carry out prospective memory tasks. Individuals
who appear deficient in prospective memory are
often characterized as “absentminded.” Research suggests that older adults are somewhat more vulnerable
to problems with prospective memory than younger
people are, although the findings are complicated and
not entirely consistent (Niedz´wien´ska & Barzykowski,
2012). In laboratory studies, older adults tend to perform more poorly than younger adults, but the opposite pattern is often seen in naturalistic studies of
performance in everyday environments, especially for
prospective memory tasks involving health and social
obligations (Schnitzspahn et al., 2016). Another interesting issue is that people increasingly depend on their
smartphones to handle prospective memory tasks. A
recent study found a decline in prospective memory
performance among heavy smartphone users that was
presumably due to reduced practice—although the
decline appeared to be reversible (Dumbrava, 2016).
latter no one prompts the individual to remember
the intended action. Thus, one needs to remember to
remember (Smith, 2016). However, experiments demonstrate that it is easy to forget to remember, especially
when one is confronted by interruptions and distractions. Although our examples of prospective memory
involve relatively trivial tasks, prospective memory is
important (Möschl et al., 2020) and crucial to daily
functioning (Anderson, Strube & McDaniel, 2019;
Gardner & Ascoli, 2015). Failures of prospective
memory can potentially have serious consequences
(Belmar et al., 2020; Stewart & McFarland, 2020).
Dismukes (2012) discusses what can happen when
prospective memory goes awry in the workplace. For
example, it appears that several airline disasters have
been attributable to pilots forgetting to complete
intended actions. In a similar vein, medical errors that
lead to negative consequences for hospital patients
often involve lapses in following through on intentions. Research indicates that sleep deprivation tends
to increase prospective memory failures, which may
contribute to major mistakes in aviation, medicine,

CONCEPT CHECK 7.3
KEY LEARNING GOAL
• Identify the three
unifying themes highlighted in this chapter.
Putting It in Perspective: Themes 2, 4, and 7
One of our integrative themes—the idea that people’s experience of the world is subjective—stood
head and shoulders above the rest in this chapter.
Let’s briefly review how the study of memory has
illuminated this idea.
First, our discussion of attention as inherently
selective should have shed light on why people’s
experience of the world is subjective. To a great
degree, what you see in the world around you
depends on where you focus your attention. This
is one of the main reasons that two people can be
exposed to the “same” events and walk away with
entirely different perceptions. Second, the reconstructive nature of memory should further explain

Human Memory 285
Finally, the multifaceted nature of memory demonstrated once again that behaviour is governed by
multiple causes. For instance, your memory of a specific event may be influenced by your attention to it,
your level of processing, your elaboration, your exposure to interference, how you search your memory
store, how you reconstruct the event, and so forth.
Given the multifaceted nature of memory, it should
come as no surprise that there are many ways to
improve memory. We discuss a variety of strategies
in the Personal Application section.
people’s tendency to view the world with a subjective slant. When you observe an event, you don’t
store an exact copy of the event in your memory.
Instead, you store a rough, “bare bones” approximation of the event that may be reshaped as time
goes by.
A second theme that was apparent in our discussion of memory is psychology’s theoretical diversity.
We saw illuminating theoretical debates about the
nature of memory storage, the causes of forgetting,
and the existence of multiple memory systems."`
